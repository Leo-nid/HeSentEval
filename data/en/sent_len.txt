te	1	Or are we two separate , but similar species ?
va	1	These will do for now , ' I said .
va	1	 The warrior is of secondary importance . 
tr	1	Looking down , he realized there was one sandwich left .
te	1	' Dear God , ' she murmured in a shaky voice .
tr	1	He groaned and crushed her mouth with his again .
te	1	Her hands twisted the hem of her sweater into a pulp .
tr	1	She had to fight the shivers running through her .
tr	1	" What were you thinking , bringing her here ?
tr	1	The girl moaned again and then her eyes slit open .
tr	1	 Yeah , this is cool , huh ? """
tr	1	"We can throw one of the books . """

tr	1	How many times had she viewed these fields from the fort ?

tr	1	 Do not be ; I think you were right .

tr	1	came the sharp cry and the truck jerked to a halt .
va	1	He stayed up a long while after that thinking .

tr	1	I finished early and decided to save her the trip .
te	1	Rafe stared hard into her softly unfocused eyes for some moments .
tr	1	His past , my past , our families all faded .
tr	1	 I 'm meeting Aimee early this morning . 
tr	1	It really looked interesting , almost like a piece of art .
tr	1	Gabe 's voice carries to my sensitive ears .
tr	1	No electricity , no cars , no shopping !
tr	1	' The keys , please , ' he said sharply .
tr	1	 Something to eat , please ,  Jeff said politely .
tr	1	Gabe snags the phone out of my hand .
va	1	The black kid watched him from the store .
te	1	I reached for the swords at my waist .
tr	1	' You look like hell , ' he said bluntly .
va	1	"Oh God , "" she repeated , her voice breaking ."
te	1	she finally asked him in a low voice .

tr	1	She winked at John and he grinned back .
te	1	 A man could do worse than be an Essene .

tr	1	They didn 't have anything grown ,  Gabe says ."
tr	1	"probably more than I make in a year . """
te	1	" We will have to go and get her .
tr	1	 She was disguised as one of the men ."

tr	1	He could almost remember what Campbell looked like .
tr	1	The other girls came bounding down the stairs and gathered around .
tr	1	 Have you heard any more news ? 
tr	1	 Never , never do that again ,  he said .
tr	1	She waited for him to notice her or make a move .
te	1	 Sure , you have the enhanced senses . 
tr	1	What did they think as they looked on this ?
te	1	One seated man had a squirming puppy in his lap .
tr	1	As to how I got this number -- don 't ask .
tr	1	The woman he had seen was still in the chamber .
tr	1	 I wonder what 's for dinner ? 
va	1	Then they faded back to his tanned flesh tone .
tr	1	Chris looked first at Fletcher , then at Woolsey .
tr	1	Rafe said nothing but his brows drew together ominously .
te	1	This will be an interesting time with her aboard the ship .

te	1	Already , my vision was starting to blur .

tr	1	She could not long keep up that flailing whirlwind .
va	1	 I won 't tell anyone ,  Noah promised her .
te	1	And I say we trust each other even after that .
tr	1	She had spread the bag open over the floor .
va	1	Noah tried to stretch , then grimaced and gave up .
tr	1	There was a soft , undeniable click after the fifth attempt .
tr	1	Another groaned on the floor next to him .
tr	1	He gathered me in his arms , and rocked me .
tr	1	Lilly Ann set a neat little trap for him .

tr	1	 Well , are you going to talk ? """
tr	1	 I need to talk to you both .

tr	1	 Hand me the lead , would you , David ? 
tr	1	I drop the limp body and keep running .
tr	1	He walked toward her uncertainly , his gaze foggy and unsure .
va	1	Chris nodded before truly understanding what the man had said .
tr	1	The words were as friendly as the tone was deadly .
tr	1	Josie gave the burnt stone body one more look .
te	1	 Yes , I would ,  answered Finan unmoved .
tr	1	 I 'll look in the barn . 
tr	1	 You are a very unusual girl . 
tr	1	' Can you wait until we have had dessert ? '
tr	1	Alejo regarded the older man calmly , face giving nothing away .

tr	2	Not until Gabe shifts in his sleep , and his energy jumps .

tr	2	Turning , he nodded toward Billy as well , asking how he was .

tr	2	Some of his men smiled with pleasure and he gave them angry warning looks .
tr	2	Yep , this is the best comeback I can muster on short notice .
tr	2	He saw her gaze jet to the bag and back again and he smiled .
tr	2	He then stepped back and held the cane high , up over his head .

tr	2	 I like your house a lot better than I like mine . 
tr	2	Bolts of electricity entered my body , zaps of pain shot through my limbs .

tr	2	 These are brand new , the first pair I 've ever owned . 
tr	2	All familiarity was gone and they treated her like in the beginning .
tr	2	" Like I said , there 's a story to it all .

tr	2	She unfolded the newspaper and spread it on the desk so he could see it .
tr	2	A third man dressed in a white evening suit followed behind them .
tr	2	The attacker was tall and seemed to be just standing there appraising him .
tr	2	Sure that the people above weren 't their brothers they started yelling for help .
tr	2	 It is only that I did not mean it like that .

tr	2	He had suddenly realized that there were worse things than merely being on the run .

tr	2	You can have the knowledge , but not the recording , it 's too dangerous .

tr	2	Virgil joined them in the dining room , just as they were sitting down .
tr	2	 But that is not the really important stuff , is it ? 
tr	2	Ever since I 'd moved to France with my dad , I 'd wanted normal .
tr	2	With each step , her cheap plastic sandals squished noisily across the tiles .

tr	2	Armed with a duster , she began with Miriam 's new room .
tr	2	 Yes , you are ,  Mana replied with complete composure .
tr	2	said Reid in a suspiciously oily voice as he stepped onto the range .
tr	2	 Approximately 32 days , Kaylie , would you like me to begin ? 
tr	2	There 'd damn well been some actual injuries , so of course they were investigating .

tr	2	" John , everything is weird when you 're in a foreign country , okay ?
tr	2	The door swung open and an icy blast of air invaded the room .
tr	2	David strode in , gave her a quick kiss and sat down .

tr	2	Seconds later , the pair made their way up towards the house .

tr	2	His hands clasped behind his back , he could hear her struggling for control .
tr	2	 Eda , please just listen ; we have to run . 
tr	2	The house seemed very empty to him what with Wendy being at Cambridge .
tr	2	Lunch was sent up , and Miriam thankfully put her pen down .
te	2	Mark himself was later accepted into West Point , and graduated in 1950 .
va	2	 Alas , my sister and I are alone in the world . 
te	2	One by one , they fell away and were pulled clear of the vessel .
tr	2	Hot tears filled my eyes , but I refused to let them fall .
tr	2	Tears streaked down her cheeks , along with most of her eye makeup .
tr	2	He pointed to another index card that looked to have larger sticks on it .
tr	2	A voice cried , loud enough to cut through the many conversations .
tr	2	"John 's right , "" he said , nodding at the back window ."
tr	2	Rand felt that he had never heard a sweeter sound than Bron returning with reinforcements .
va	2	Several cars screeched to a stop on the road next to me .
tr	2	Joseph nodded and said we would go on to Jerusalem and to the Temple .

tr	2	Sarah watched it as if she were watching a movie with the sound turned off .
tr	2	He laid it on the table and slid it across for the boys to see .
te	2	The road was rocky and uneven , but the wind was gentle .
tr	2	" I am very sorry Damian , but I cannot do this .
tr	2	I remained like a donkey in the rain and an urge started to cover me .
tr	2	I jumped over my luggage and started to charge them chaotically with things and clothes .
tr	2	I was not the type to risk his life for the sake of science .
tr	2	I took the elevator with the luggage after me , and pushed the downstairs button .
tr	2	I was already on the other side of the street , heading to a taxi .
tr	2	I putted my sunglasses on and I waited in silence until the destination .
tr	2	I paid 15 euros to the driver and I was heading to the booking office .
tr	2	I simply cannot do it , plus that I feel lost here . "
va	2	Now I should say a lot of people came to Old Sarah .
tr	2	Rafe drew his sword and turned to meet the hunting party as they approached .
tr	2	I can only recommend him without reservation , and go on studying him .
va	2	' Viola ' total silence - and not a funeral pyre in sight .
tr	2	This symposium is an attempt to find ways to straighten out this mess .
tr	2	He almost didn 't recognize her when she walked out of the Tube station .
va	2	She had dreaded the day when she would take her last pill .
tr	2	Sarah crossed the living room and began pulling books off the shelves .
tr	2	Lo taps in a code on the keypad and presses his thumb against the screen .
tr	2	The cottage interior seemed to have been stripped of anything of value .
tr	2	She could feel the trees and road calling her , beckoning her onward .
tr	2	She stiffened , then curled up on the sleeping bag , eyes squeezed shut .
tr	2	 Whatever the reason , I am most grateful for your sudden recollection . 
tr	2	' You think this has something to do with surviving the seventeenth death ? '

tr	2	his piercing eyes dropped first to his friend 's leg then stared up at him .

tr	2	 I can see why it 's a secret ,  she said .
tr	2	But if this was her home , he had fatherly duties to do .
tr	2	"They 're trying to kill us , "" David replied , almost hysterical ."
tr	2	Out of the corner of my eyes , I saw Anna look around wildly .
tr	2	Finally the only person that was left in the room with them was Davis .
va	2	They 'd both made it out of the tunnels alive , but what for ?
tr	2	I hit the ground , rolled to one knee and rapidly squeezed the triggers .
te	2	Mark and Maria took a tentative step forward , out of the elevator .
tr	2	If this didn 't snap Rowan to , then a tornado wouldn 't do it .
te	2	 Tell me what you know about Gema Mason , Robbie  asked Jennie .

tr	2	I drowned in your spirit , Lilly Ann , your beauty and your grace .
tr	2	Tommy wanted to laugh as the prince 's curls dangled over his face .
tr	2	As he spoke , the statistics appeared in colorful displays all around the two reporters .
tr	2	My body opens to the sunlight , taking in the thin stream of sustenance .
tr	2	Gradually he had learnt to suffer the discomfort he felt in their presence stoically .

tr	2	 I do not know ; I thought I heard something . 
tr	2	" I think Toby is just happy to have a father figure around .

tr	2	After putting the shotguns away he took out two locked steel cases .

tr	2	 How are we to know the will of the Lord ? 
tr	2	She also could see them looking at each other when they thought no one noticed .

tr	3	Ethan felt the enormity of the moment upon him and something akin to a physical rush .

te	3	I hadn 't seen it so clearly before , but now it was so clear that it thrilled me .
tr	3	I sit on the edge of the bed and listen to his steps retreat down the hall .
tr	3	 No , but I can make sure no one takes it from me again . 
tr	3	 Let 's get Tom Kelly to put a heavy guard on the Moffett site .

tr	3	He ran in joy towards a scene that he thought was his , intuition cautioned him and he stopped .

tr	3	There was no need for two of them all the time after this was finished , though .
tr	3	He sat down next to Mana and looked through the books that were piled next to her .

va	3	He had begun to care about her , to be protective of her , fearful for her safety .
tr	3	If anyone was watching they 'd move to follow her friends and she 'd see them .
tr	3	Lars and Helen were dancing , for my surprise Lars did not praise himself for no propose .
tr	3	She looked as though she were going to read a novel , or have some tea .
tr	3	He realized , now that he gave it some thought , that they often employed re-usable forms .

tr	3	Even as I watched breathlessly behind him , the sentry began stamping his feet and clapped his hands together .

tr	3	Bennett had been holding back the tears as his hand was crushed , broken in at least ten places .
tr	3	A second later , his eyelids fluttered open once more and he struggled to focus on my face .
tr	3	 Should I start worrying about my stuff now or right before we get back ? 
tr	3	 Captain Myers here will serve as guide to the location of the tanks ,  said Anderson .
te	3	 I knew he was too old for war , but he didn 't listen ,  Mother wept .
tr	3	Moments later , video images from dozens of security cameras appeared in separate frames on the screen .
tr	3	Alfred held Victoria by the arm , letting the group pass and get ahead of them .
va	3	They 'd killed his brother , and I 'd be damned if they would kill him too .

tr	3	" You know , this will sound weird but Damian 's dad came to me in a dream .
tr	3	A young man , with blond long hair ... I dreamt a very beautiful mansion , Mrs. Kate .

tr	3	Silence , I was hearing only the raindrops outside and my thoughts , being so tortuous and weird .
tr	3	 It really doesn 't matter , if he is the Damian I know or not ."
tr	3	Sampson was in all regards a military dictator and had mobilized every available resource to his ends .

tr	3	She turned just in time to see Mal topple over the edge on the other side .
tr	3	His sudden leap carried him up in the air , ten feet over the giant 's head .
tr	3	It must have been a rhetorical question , because the man didn 't wait for a response .
tr	3	I skidded to a halt on the muddy , leaf covered ground and stumbled back towards him .
te	3	As we headed towards an exit on the other side , I glanced around and froze in my tracks .
te	3	Simon opened his mouth to protest , but his eyes were closing against the material of her white uniform .
tr	3	"It 's all in the instructions but I haven 't tried any of it yet . """
tr	3	He sat on a bench , towel over his shoulders , listening to the crowd roaring .

va	3	He averted his face , pained by the recollection and wishing that the memories would recede .
tr	3	It is what I make of it and that lot may not be chosen for any man .
tr	3	The happiest of these men stood erect at the bow of Clem Johnson 's fishing boat .

tr	3	We have been through much together these last few days , and we will certainly face greater trials ahead .
va	3	I stood up and wandered towards the nearest shop , a humble affair that smelled deliciously of warm bread .
tr	3	This arrangement provided the families greater protection from the increased acts of robbery and violence outside the prison .
tr	3	Both times , they caught me and beat me until I truly realized that I had to submit .
tr	3	John asked , looking from the rain to his mother 's face as if trying to decipher her thoughts .

tr	3	Jimmy gave a wide smile - not like anything Josie had ever seen him do before .
te	3	A face peers into mine , and for a blissful moment I don 't recognize it .
te	3	His ambition is limited to reaching the height of expertise in the skills he 's chosen to focus upon .
tr	3	Very different from Alexandria where there had been so many Greek and Roman women always in the crowds .
tr	3	She held the other end of the vine in her fist and climbed onto the bridge .

tr	3	 I don 't know whether it will do the job or not ,  quoth she .

tr	3	Source is not concerned about any of us messing up her perfect song with our imperfect vibration .
tr	3	Not for the first time he marveled at how his superiors could blend in so well .
tr	3	We would watch from our place , but we would all be within the walls of the Temple .
tr	3	It was their land , the most beautiful they had ever known and they were not safe .

tr	3	 Yes , Colonel Walker , that was the silver lining to this particular cloud I suppose ."
tr	3	Glancing toward the open door , he heard his name shouted again and recognized it was Arthur Cobb .
tr	3	I should have come up with something better , she thought as she looked back at the stream .
tr	3	She is too much of a lady for riff-raff to speak of her in that fashion .
tr	3	 Sure , nobody would come help an ugly crow like me ,  she said laughing .
te	3	Suddenly Mal grabbed them by their collars and threw them into a crevice in the rocks .
te	3	If Dan doesn 't snap out of his injury soon , we 'll walk to town .
tr	3	Simultaneously the soldiers hung their weapons on the racks on the walls and filed into the dining hall .
tr	3	Frowning sharply , Alejo opened his mouth just as they dropped their burden to the dewy grass .
tr	3	They were beating them with their fists , and a wild series of notes burst from the pipes .
tr	3	I didn 't contradict the man , but I sure hoped the dog would continue to be deceived .
tr	3	It was touch and go for a moment and I really thought that was where we all would die .
tr	3	They 're not moving this way , but it 'd be death for us all if they did .

tr	3	Licking his thumbs , he began turning pages while glancing at the coin every now and then .
tr	3	 I had always hoped that such a thing might happen ,  continued Lord Brogan .
tr	3	I flipped the security panel open and connected a pair of wires to the back of the device .
tr	3	That day I will never forget not even Laurence explanations or meeting Alex on the beach .
tr	3	"I kissed the soft spot below his ear and mumbled , "" Actually , I 'm just joking . """
tr	3	If he does , what do you think the man in him is going to want ?

tr	3	The afternoon sky was robin 's egg blue , with high puffy clouds moving in lockstep across the horizon .
tr	3	His laugh is warm and inviting , somehow untouched by the sheer catastrophe of the situation at hand .
tr	3	I rose unsteadily to my feet and stared at the impenetrable barrier with a sinking feeling .
tr	3	It made her sad , thinking about the family she 'd left behind when she went on her Journey .
tr	3	Nearby , Logan 's horse galloped neck and neck with mine , its rider stone-faced and frowning in concentration .
tr	3	If he grew more annoyed as Miriam and Neil stuck together , he didn 't show it .
va	3	The deck 's walls were sheer glass , and several comfortable chairs had been placed facing the view .
te	3	And yes , there are many who work with their hands , and they have to .
tr	3	The camera showed Mrs. Thompson checking in Gema 's briefcase and then summoning Robert the guard .
tr	3	His phone buzzed with an automated selection notice before he had even logged off from the terminal .

tr	3	Once I got to the In-Between , I 'd ... well , I 'd think of something .

tr	3	' We couldn 't afford to lose the virus or have it spread through contact with the air . '

tr	3	"Here , let 's move it up so you have to do it right to make it over . """
te	3	She kissed his hair , his cheek , she rubbed her forehead back and forth across his sharp beard .

tr	3	At the end of the year , you can stay if we like or you step down peacefully .
tr	3	 It 's not part of the route , but we started every morning here . 
tr	3	Jacob refused to cooperate unless his two college friends could be located and brought into the deal .
va	3	"She sat down again , and began to type as fast as before : "" Nerves on edge ."
tr	3	"A couple of them got in my way , but it wasn 't hard taking them out . """
tr	3	I stared at the figures for a while longer , before slipping the frame inside my coat .
tr	3	From his perch on the upper deck , he shouted commands to the men below who manned chrysanthemum cannons .
tr	3	He turned and headed back down the hill and then took the path in the opposite direction .
tr	3	I came upon the home and slipped up the entry staircase to pound on the door .
tr	3	The Stark land , woods , lodge , lake and all , covered two square miles .
tr	3	" As staff , you are supposed to do everything possible to fulfill our spy experience .
tr	3	Not only did you both screw up at the Louvre , but --  My eyes widened ."
tr	3	Since she had been starting to head down the other side there was no way for her to help .
te	3	The woman in the white uniform brought a tray to his bed and put it on the round table .
tr	3	And her reaction was an instantaneous action to strike someone from the list of the living .
tr	3	He smiled to realize it solved another mystery too , that of the llamas missing hair .
tr	3	"Maybe I 've eaten something that 's upset my stomach , I might throw up . """
va	3	Then he leaped to his feet and whipped around , his face almost as red as the red-faced guy .

tr	3	Nothing registered on my face , but he 'd gone too far mocking my highly refined methods of defense .
tr	3	I 'd wanted to play dumb the whole time , but I needed to push and get a reaction .
tr	3	It had nothing to do with the fact that he had my insides tied into knots .
tr	3	With one suave move , he whipped the serving tray out and let it clatter to the floor .
tr	3	I 'd hoped the girl knew something about her or had seen her on the job . "
tr	3	Beyond the tall grass , it was red with the light of the sun that was almost gone away .

tr	3	Chatting and smiling and gently nudging , Sarah got him off the porch and into the cart .
tr	3	She was already out of the cart and back up the porch steps , not waiting for an answer .
tr	3	The last time she heard voices outside a cottage door , they had been friendly ones .
tr	3	Just because she was terrified didn 't mean these men were necessarily a threat to her .
tr	3	The first thing she saw was the immediate absence of something that should have been there but wasn 't .
tr	3	She didn 't know if there was any kind of a weapon there but all other avenues were blocked .
tr	3	Sarah felt herself slide in and out of consciousness as she listened to the harsh voices .
tr	3	The man with his hand on her raised his fist and held it to her face .
tr	3	Sarah directed her attention back to Seamus who was sitting quietly as if engaged in his own thoughts .
tr	3	 Just kill ' im , "" the lout said , as he moved back to his horse ."
tr	3	 You were always a lucky lad , but that is unbelievable luck ,  said William .
te	3	 Colonel , if I miss something I could get a lot of good people killed . 
tr	3	Eventually , it all became white noise as I studied the grime on the inside of the door .
tr	3	 Or as your press release put it , the equivalent of forty SUV 's ? 
tr	3	 You 'll make more than that in a season , using them as brood mares . 
tr	3	In the little hut entered three drunk boys and when they saw me , they stopped in the threshold .
tr	3	He puts his hand on mines and looks directly into my eyes , making me blush .
tr	3	Lonnie and Ricky silently agreed but they weren 't about to join her in her contempt .
tr	3	 But where were you married to your betrothed and where was your son born ? 
tr	3	I would try to remember the words to some of them and teach you to sing with me .
tr	3	"Sam said , "" Got a good point , I still can 't believe they did that . """
tr	3	For a while they could hear her begging , crying and screaming , but without any help .

tr	3	 You do not wish to do procreation and receive a child in your belly ? 
tr	3	" As I mentioned , I 've only been there once and only for a week .
tr	3	Martin was very taken with the place though , so it should be in good condition .
tr	3	The building 's made to look like a medieval castle , although it 's a relatively new construction .
tr	3	The cliché was a bit much , but seeing the others around the room , it was true .
tr	3	Phillip , Jacob , Logan , Eva , and I were eliminated right away for obvious reasons .
tr	3	Then all those without trade skills were removed ; our man needed a cover story of some sort .
tr	3	Finally the lot was drawn , and a lanky fellow with shockingly blond hair was selected .
tr	3	Phillip would be murdered , and we 'd suffer some ignoble death at the hands of a charlatan .
tr	3	The institute 's chefs prepared untold delights , and all ate and drank with complete abandon .

va	3	He saw the tall thin man trying to crawl under one of the cars , bleeding badly .
tr	3	Roberto expected disgust , but for some reason she did not look at him in that manner .
te	3	 There 's a thousand clay pigeons hidden in the garage that go with it ,  said Jennie .
tr	3	She had the air of a woman who had come into familiar territory , within call of friends .

tr	3	Then , as best as he could remember , the fruit was stirred and what it was mixed with .
tr	3	Cal reached over to Kevin 's shirt pocket and pushed the button on the remote through the fabric .
va	3	" Yea I know ,  said George , "" I was just talking to her ."
tr	3	A tavern is mostly where people go to get drunk , but they sell some food there .
tr	3	Surely tiny limbs like those would freeze in the mountain winters -- perhaps they lived further south .
tr	3	There was something odd in the way he said run which immediately raised a red flag .
tr	3	 Hi , Joey ,  he 'd said with a smile , and then I 'd seen Acacia .
tr	3	Her heart raced but she nodded her head in acceptance and placed it in her skirt pocket .
te	3	 I don 't give the money to you ,  he said to the woman .
tr	3	Acacia was struggling to her feet , using the wide tree trunk behind her as leverage .
tr	3	 Then surely we are safe , for they will not come this way again , will they ? 
tr	3	 Unless , of course , you believe we 're about to be attacked by pirates . 
tr	3	He heard the squeal of dusty brakes then heard a thud before another rifle shot rang out .

tr	3	The silver plate was chased with gold and the helm he carried under one arm matched .
tr	3	The horses panicked , flailing around and preventing the adults from getting back to the wagon to stop it .
tr	3	It was also very strange that the helicopters only took about three pints of fuel between them .

va	3	" It was considered that the knowledge that she was betrothed would keep her safe from such disappointment .
tr	3	Her sleepy voice was pleasantly husky , and her eye lashes fluttered sleepily over large eyes .
tr	3	It was a difficult situation and , whatever people said , this betrothal was not in the least romantic .
tr	3	She closed the door noiselessly and made her way to the sanctity of her own chamber .
tr	3	While not ecstatic the gentle feelings of respect and regard were enough upon which to build a successful marriage .
tr	3	However Adele was indeed awake , laying upon her back and staring into the blackness of her room .
tr	3	Adele found this rather endearing , in the same way she would have found a kitten endearing .
tr	3	She would , she decided , take great pains to see that Lord Rafe felt easy around her .
tr	3	Adele felt , for the first time , the full force of what leaving would mean to her .
tr	3	They had been treasured and bore every sign of the eagerness with which she had devoured them .
tr	3	After all he had given she could not withdraw , for he had her promise too .
tr	3	Yes , now he had the added delight of dragging Lady Adele 's companion along with them .
tr	3	He knew his own faults well enough to be certain that they would not deal well together .
tr	3	Nothing would change the fact that they were bound together ; he might as well accept it .
tr	3	Truth be told he was in the grip of such conflicting emotions he felt a little confused .
tr	3	Rafe decided in those first few moments that her hair was probably not the only mousy thing about her .
tr	3	She must think him someone he was not , it might as well be Finan as anyone .
tr	3	About him there was an aura of impatient tension and , she decided , he was probably decisive .
tr	3	Her dress was the colour of primroses , soft and pretty , ridiculous in the depths of winter .
tr	3	Rafe was taken aback by the image , and felt very stupid for conceiving such a foolish notion .
tr	3	Rafe thought it was woollen but did not intend to get close enough to find out for sure .
tr	3	Her hair long and curling , and was caught back from her face to hang down her back .
tr	3	Adele thought he might have used the same calculating inspection when weighing up the points of a horse .
tr	3	The fingers of his left hand tugged at the leather tassels on his belt betraying his discomfort .
tr	3	Adele stared at the large horse before her , her eyes running over its great muscular frame .
tr	3	Rafe watched the dubious expression cross her face and realised he would have to help her mount .
tr	3	It struck Adele that she should be anxious and frightened , but Eda was a comforting presence behind her .
tr	3	Adele and Eda continued to wave to the ladies of the fort until they were lost from sight .
tr	3	She decided that she didn 't care , it was rather amusing to watch him labouring under such chagrin .
tr	3	They passed through the village and picked their way through the patchwork of fields that surrounded it .
tr	3	For the first time Lady Adele felt slighted , that he should accord his horse more civility than her .
tr	3	Chief among these was the conviction that it was going to be a long journey home .
tr	3	For now I 'm only pleased to share his warmth , and Eda has ridden before . "

tr	3	The inside of the hut wasn 't much different from the healer 's , minus the jars and herbs .
tr	3	 That 's why the other two looked for your approval to leave ,  he said .
tr	3	We decided to leave early ; that is , we wanted to get away before anyone was up .
tr	3	As before , Jai was across from me and Jo was next to me , both asleep or unconscious .
tr	3	' That still doesn 't change the fact that you 're a jackass , ' said Reid .
tr	3	 The fact that he has not is proof that something is very wrong ,  returned Adele .
tr	3	He held on tightly and enjoyed her soft body against him , his hands brushing the soft skin .

tr	3	Nevertheless , the snow was so pretty , and so clean before it struck the ground .
tr	3	pleading , suddenly her body stiffened and a wail came out of her mouth like a wounded animal .
tr	3	Missy rode it several times sitting down and then dared to go up standing , facing the tree .
tr	3	Rafe would have been furious , knowing that he had no way to defend himself or his actions .
tr	3	She decided to go to the upper deck to dry her hair in the midday sun .
tr	3	It had started to snow and the wind was threatening to drift the snow against the buildings .

te	3	They passed by the Hall of Angels and came up to a silver door decorated with engravings of angels .

tr	3	Looking at my brother 's face , I realize that I 've just lost my lunch .

te	3	What was more disturbing was that Josie seemed to be going along with this crazy idea .
tr	3	Soon , wrapped in the thick furs of his bed , his breath crystallized into white fog .
tr	3	Bethany cleaned and bandaged his wound with care as they waited in the snowy cold ditch for nightfall .
tr	3	 This is crazy ,  she muttered quietly as an unarmed guard scanned their driver 's licenses .

tr	3	 Hi , Jessie ,  she responded , with no hesitation to decide on which name to use .

tr	3	It 's a personal expression , a calling card , and an art form just as any other .
tr	3	 So what 's the big news that you had to tell me in person ? 
tr	3	Biscuit wasn 't quite fast enough and was hit four times as he tried to take cover .
tr	3	 I know many of those songs ,  Brand said , his voice still trembling .

tr	3	 Did you stare at it when you first saw it because of its size ? 
tr	3	Bits of white that might have been shells embedded in the amalgam were now free and floating on top .
tr	3	On the other side , lit ever so faintly by the sun which waited to rise , were woods .
va	3	Harold insisted on civility , but in a couple of cases that was simply too much to ask .
va	3	If Aimee was on any kind of innocent trip , her grandmother would know about it .
tr	3	The windows were open to bright sunlight and there was a light breeze blowing the curtains gently .
tr	3	One of the other soldiers was quietly scoffing , and the mean soldier held his peace .
te	3	Flaherty shook his head to clear it and felt himself being hauled roughly to his feet .
tr	3	The solid sound of metal hitting flesh was followed by the crashing of a body down through the branches .
te	3	We were in , I could feel Ra tearing through flesh and hear men screaming in rage and terror .
tr	3	She did have on a warm cardigan over the lacy white blouse Quechua ladies always wore .

va	3	By the time the knock came on the apartment door , Alejo felt like he 'd been awake forever .
tr	3	Then it occurred to him what her answer meant : packing up , and no privacy until nightfall .
va	3	Incredibly , the top hatch of the tank opened and a blond haired man stuck his head out .
tr	3	Trees had started to appear again , but the fog was still as thick as ever .
va	3	We spent the weekend planting potatoes , talking gardening , greenhouses , and livestock while enjoying the Glen .
tr	3	 Nah , I gave up on that when you stood up to the Old Man .

va	4	In a flash of brilliance , accompanied by a rumble that shook the display , came a dart trailing fire into the sky .
tr	4	They discussed the events since they had met Lilly Ann on the highway and were excited about the promises of the upcoming day .
tr	4	It opened , and I followed the path that was home , leaving the dead Walkers and the empty one behind .
te	4	He dropped the margarine and cream off in the refrigerator , carefully tied up the bread in its bag with a perfect little knot .
tr	4	And the private museum , open only now and then , including the dolls which he himself had personally cherished .

tr	4	He stopped to crouch down a few times and examine the sand , now and then seeming to wipe away an invisible something .
tr	4	The bottom of the well is an unpleasant sight , the distorted brick walls and dirty paths leading outward in a maze of darkness .
tr	4	With every one of these thoughts he is paddling upstream against the current and he doesn 't get anywhere close to his new shirt .
tr	4	He 'd brought with him ten other people , five of them able-bodied men and the rest women and children .
tr	4	After all , they had a greater chance of running into them on this trip than they had with the Assassins .
tr	4	So loud was the talk that I could not even tell how many were for Janet 's point of view or against it .
te	4	Her feet rang out on the stones , and then he swept her up again , running faster than they could run together .
tr	4	Despite my confidence , I was still wary ; it wouldn 't do to fall asleep and be taken so easily .
tr	4	Certainly , they were sleeping in ones and twos , but there had been people working nonstop throughout the entire time .
tr	4	" When I was around your age my mother told me something that our family used to always tell our children .

tr	4	 I guess we have to come up with a few new tricks then ,  Michael picked up the joking tone .
tr	4	The shadows of the living had long since passed into the shadows of night and those creatures that abound through it .

tr	4	If they were aware of him maybe he should step out into the open , he thought , then decided against that .

tr	4	 Yeah , I got that same feeling ,  Rift agrees , now surrounded by the angry sea dwellers .
tr	4	When World War II broke out , Mark was too young to fight - but watched as his older brothers went off to fight .

tr	4	This is where I should have made some growling , scary sound and gotten everybody freaked out and running back to the fair .
te	4	Their enemy had certainly shown little in the way of tactical expertise but their equipment was good , if somewhat unimaginative .
tr	4	Our relationship was filled with laughter , adventure and great sex that never got awkward or just a tiny bit boring sometimes .
tr	4	The burst of combined charge charred his face and the force of the resultant blow sent him flying into his comrades .
tr	4	 What are you never going to tell me ,  Oh , he was really getting good at this .
tr	4	" Maybe ,  Lilly Ann replied vaguely , "" but for the students here there are no required studies or subjects ."
tr	4	 If by ' beautiful city ' you mean a cesspool of corruption , then yes , it is . 
tr	4	However , I 'm not going to marry someone whose best claim to decent behavior is that they 've ' been nice today ' .
tr	4	An outbreak had struck the Ares one week out of Earth perihelion and most movement throughout the ship had been severely curtailed .
tr	4	 I could break my car so you can fix it again ,  Lilly Ann suggested only half jokingly .
te	4	 We have an ad out on Craigslist for a stuffy British butler , but so far , no luck ,  Gabe says .
va	4	" Honey , I hate to hurt your feelings , but I think you girls would only get in the way .
tr	4	It was obvious his words hurt her feelings , as well as the rest of the girls , except maybe Jessica .
tr	4	she stared at him like a mother would stare at a child whose hand was still in the cookie jar .
tr	4	Think about it , Rick , you 'd let them go to Washington DC for a field trip , wouldn 't you ?
tr	4	Rick wrapped his arm around her neck and pretended to squeeze ,  Yes , that is what I intend to do !"
te	4	Somewhat subdued , Miriam gathered up her pencils , and Mana went down to arrange a picnic lunch with Mrs. Williams .
va	4	She realized with a jolt of something like shock in her stomach that they had fallen asleep curled up together .
tr	4	Either the man knew no English or was in shock , but clearly he understood the intent of Jacob 's aggression .
tr	4	As my eyes adjusted to the sunlight , I noticed three figures resting under the tree , lounging in comfortable chairs .
tr	4	"The fused shadow was not enough to keep it intact , "" he reveals , shooting the dark helm a disapproving gaze ."
tr	4	' If you think we 're playing catch with this , you 've got another thing coming , ' said Reid .
tr	4	I stayed quiet when a young family burst from the front door in a babble of excitement , ready for a day of exploring .
tr	4	With the bleeding completely stopped , he slowly released the tourniquet and watched for leakages at the end of the stump .
tr	4	In response to his question , I grabbed one of the silver chairs and rolled it under the air duct .
tr	4	The Prince 's heart fluttered nervously again , even though he knew his sister 's powers did not extend to mind reading .
tr	4	Nathan took back his weapons before turning and walking towards the barricade with Bethany and the boys falling in behind him .
tr	4	When the fuel truck had left , Taylor opened the engine cowl and started with the preflight inspection of his airplane .
tr	4	His only other tangible role was as a liaison to the NASA center , farther down the slopes of the mountain .
tr	4	She rummaged through the top drawer ... nothing but the usual stuff , pens , pencils , paper clips , his diary .
tr	4	"I said , "" That was a fantastic shot , you nailed him honey , look ... that damn things bigger than the canoe ."
tr	4	It was a fine weapon , the black leather hilt inlaid with gold in the shape of three crossed arrows .
tr	4	 Stand aside until the tree is raised up enough ,  Taylor yelled and jumped back into the vehicle .
tr	4	At that moment , whatever thoughts Chris entertained earlier about the man being full-on crazy were now confirmed beyond doubt .
tr	4	 Be still ,  the Professor 's voice commanded , carrying easily above the din though he was still nowhere to be seen .
tr	4	Waiting to see which side his antagonist appears on , he is far from prepared when Mai shouts a warning .
tr	4	He and Gabriel leaped into the truck and began to carefully pull the blanket with Alejo 's prostrate form towards the door .
tr	4	But the men were still fighting over who was to be crucified , and when she spoke we couldn 't hear her words .
tr	4	' She didn 't know if this bit of information was of any use , but hoped that it might be ' .
tr	4	I hardly noticed and finished clipping the fresh chambers into place before raising the guns once more , my stride unbroken .
tr	4	 Of course , it 's hard to determine the exact age and vessel type just by looking at it ,  he said .
va	4	Bowing again , they returned the way they had come , silhouettes swaying with the gentle rock of the ship .
tr	4	She thought of the disappointment on John 's face if she had to tell him tonight that there was no bread .
tr	4	He also had managed to latch on to the flood of e-mails that had originated with that ominous censored message .
tr	4	Since she was often secured with her back to the boards it was easy enough to carry her to the wagon .
tr	4	" I wish you to take notice , Adele ; I have returned safely , just as I promised I would .

tr	4	"I can 't wait to hear -- "" "" There 's no time , "" Eva gushed , her breath ragged ."
tr	4	He let it burn about halfway before reaching back and heaving it into the air , up and over the dune .

te	4	Although he still moved with a hint of difficulty , his recovery was wonderful , and the man was becoming more and more active .
tr	4	I was one of a lucky few who had managed to get their hands on a limited edition midnight black version .
tr	4	The shift in weight and direction of their discussions was invigorating on the one hand but slightly confusing all the while .
tr	4	But I had not been in the darkest forest for very long when I heard the voices of the Little People .
tr	4	It was Henri 's body , but my son , unbeknownst to me then , was not present in this shade .
tr	4	I gazed at her profile and the elegant lines of her neck while she spoke , her hands twisting fitfully together .
tr	4	Although Roberto was the son of the Falcon , the Falcon would not hesitate to kill him for disobeying a direct order .

tr	4	 No , you didn 't , but it 's quite all right to say it now ,  said Rowan .
tr	4	 Good call ,  Rift has to admit , managing not to panic when he sees her in danger this time around .
tr	4	Something was different , but she could not put her finger on it , nor could she lend voice to it .
tr	4	David was breathing in great gasps of air , Nathan wasn 't sure that he wouldn 't take off again .
tr	4	I breathe in the musk of aging paper and ink , and the aroma is so much more powerful than I remember .
tr	4	She remembered passing out , and that Alejo had hit her , and yeah , the pain was definitely still there .
tr	4	Well , I can 't just lie here with those doings underneath me she reasoned and got out of bed .
tr	4	" What with losing my Jamie , I don 't know how to thank you --  "" The cow , "" Sarah said ."

tr	4	He 'd only known Toby for a little over two months ; she needed to stay away from this subject for now .
tr	4	I followed Reid to the exit and stepped off the plane , the wind whipping at my jumpsuit as I dropped forward .

te	4	Yet both Rafe and Finan knew that their presence beside him in these moments calmed him , and allowed him to relax .
te	4	" We 'll try to blend in , get what we need , and get out as fast as we can .
tr	4	If one man blends in , then I 'll do as well as you -- only I can run if things go bad . "
tr	4	The air had lost its wintry chill and the sun was warm on my face when I stepped out of the van .
te	4	I told him about Olsson , the circumstances behind his apparent death in Boston ten years previously and his recent appearance in my life .
tr	4	After he regained his health , he arranged for a ship that was willing to wait for us and came back with enough food .
te	4	Even as I 'm scrambling for my balance , the branch trembles , and Amber is standing in front of me again .

tr	4	 Yes indeed we should , for I fear we are to expect rain before the day is much older .

tr	4	The key functions of this organization should include intelligence collection in all forms , counterintelligence , and security at the state or higher level .
tr	4	Two nearly identical witches hover above the ground upon their broomsticks , their bulbous eyes and large noses portraying them very stereotypically .
tr	4	Stalin had also gotten a really weird picture of his parents wearing matching lime green t-shirts at a rally for world peace .

tr	4	I wondered how many men had gained his confidence with the sad story and why he 'd trusted us with it so readily .

tr	4	The musician was gone , but a few patrons still sat about nursing their ale or wine and gambling over dice and cards .
tr	4	The look on his face would have sent her scurrying away just as the poor innkeeper did , if she could have scurried .

te	4	 Well if you must know , I am Tola and we are in South America , I think ,  I replied .
te	4	At once the crowd shifted and moved against them , pushing them slowly from the head of the table , towards the foot .
tr	4	His hands found her shoulders protectively , as if he would yank her out of the man 's view if necessary .
tr	4	" Look for a note and dust the whole place , it 's a crime scene until I say different .
tr	4	The pub was a warm , cozy place the flickering flames of the fire winking off the horse brasses on the walls .
tr	4	He died from a heart failure brought on by a savage blow to the chest , he was dying when he entered the water .
tr	4	He was trying to figure out how the hell he had gotten involved in this crap when his mobile rang urgently .
tr	4	I have him in the house but he 's a bit hypothermic , he 's going to be OK though .
tr	4	The gates were closed when he arrived , he got out of the Land Rover and made to open them .
tr	4	 Stop right where you are , "" a soft Irish brogue from the dark , a flashlight right in his face blinding him ."
tr	4	The blade and silks inspired respect in the cautious , but fools saw the scrawny boy and not the dervish .
te	4	Missy ate dinner with her great-grandfather and a family from Georgia who had been coming up to the lodge for over twenty years .
tr	4	I know all the words my mother knew before I was born , and a great many my father knew .
tr	4	 But it 'll be easier for you to watch that one person than all of us ,  he said .
te	4	Moving toward the open field beyond the barn , Rift spots a farmhand busily scooping fodder with a hay fork .
te	4	In 2002 I put aside everything else and decided to focus entirely on answering the questions that had dogged me all my life .
va	4	He watched calmly , his mind moving at extraordinary speeds , as the arrows left the bows , and he moved causally aside .
tr	4	They would make their way north on the fringes of the mountains as far as the black army would allow .
va	4	 Sir , many of my colleagues are wondering what exactly you were thinking when you made this deal in New York . 
tr	4	 You don 't have to apologize , I came in Greece yesterday and trust me , the same thing I did . 
tr	4	 Come , we 've a long way to go yet ,  he said , setting off toward the west .
tr	4	" You never told me you published any papers on the subject , but they must have impressed the hell out of somebody .
tr	4	I don 't know how in the hell Bright came across them , but I wish he hadn 't . "
tr	4	George promptly called David and brought him up to speed who in turn alerted the teams on the other three .
tr	4	One of them held a dove gray tarp , folded neat and square ; this would be to wrap Sami 's body .
te	4	Only Tim Farmer did not seem to mind and eagerly jumped out of the car as soon as it came to a halt .
tr	4	The sparse puddles of water remaining have long since dried up , their last drops offered to the rocky fissures high above .
tr	4	Henry Star , celebrity of One Truth is meeting me , and I am in a Chrysler Town and Country .
va	4	There were three such bunkers , each with a heavy machine gun , currently holding up the advance of Ghost 's company .
tr	4	While Brendan assembled a mealy sandwich to share with him , David couldn 't help but watch him in wonder .
tr	4	Sam felt it in his stomach that this issue would find its way onto his desk rather sooner than later .
tr	4	 Heck , I don 't know what 's wrong , we were designed by the lowest bidder after all . 
tr	4	" I told ya she wouldn 't believe us , we need to just take her out back and prove it to her .
te	4	At first nothing happens , I just think they are really determined to drag this out as long as possible .
te	4	But I couldn 't argue with them anymore , the truth was right in front of my face , they are Sirens .
te	4	A few minutes later Chloe comes back in smiling ,  Ready to go pick up your stuff , Hannah ?"
va	4	He explained how he had been working in the backyard when he noticed the intruders , who must not have known he was home .
tr	4	He ceremoniously opened the clasp of a thin gold chain that he was wearing under his shirt around his neck .
tr	4	He hands me a bottle of water , and I didn 't know I was thirsty , but I am .
te	4	They 've taken over a large portion of the city and police aren 't even allowing entry into their areas .
tr	4	 Why thank you , 007 ,  said Victoria , who looked stunning in her red dress and high heels .
tr	4	Hell maybe they were lesbians for all I knew , problem solved , anyway when all was said and done they were still women .
tr	4	 As you wish , my Iseo ,  he replied , his smile revealing the perfection of his mouth again .
te	4	As he watched , the stars began to slide past him , and the boat appeared to pick up speed .
te	4	Silently dropping a rupee into his cup , Zelda continues on , primarily concerned it will be the only money he receives all day .
tr	4	If I didn 't need my boots , I swear I would gnaw on the leather and boil the soles into soup .
tr	4	The men on both sides fought as madly as the women , and already the room and the hall beyond were strewn with corpses .
tr	4	Chapter 9 Of Fish and Sticks Once safely in bed , sleep eluded Iseo as a dream eludes the sleeper upon awakening .

tr	4	I couldn 't stop until he crushed me against his chest , and I couldn 't twist or turn there .
tr	4	Just as he 'd hoped , Link raises his shield to block , unaware just how hard the kid intends to hit him .
tr	4	He decided to put his heavy weapons there and focus his efforts initially on building a strong defense where the locks met the land .
tr	4	Kaylie and Christy each rose next and placed a napkin in Rick and Abby 's laps before returning to their seats .
tr	4	"I sent my father a letter after I 'd gone ; he 'd never have agreed to it in the first place . """
tr	4	"Bright said , "" So now you 're over here at seven in the morning dumping it in my lap ."
va	4	Feeling a newfound sense of power and pride , the boy continues out of the area with his head held high .
tr	4	About that time John came back up the stairs from below with a wide grin and nearly skipped up to them .
tr	4	They used the forest as cover as long as it was available , dashing for short sprints from clump to clump when it broke .
tr	4	Kenna removed a thick steel dagger at her side -- her only weapon -- and handed it to the guards .
tr	4	 Bring forth the most precious jewel before the Five Mystics of Angels ,  intoned one of the generals .
va	4	 I put it back on the night I sent you away , I 've never been an hour without it . 
tr	4	I wanted to know desperately what happened in the first century , and why people in general never talked about it .
tr	4	Sensing the mood in the room , one of his favorite girls shyly approaches , hoping to put minds at ease .
tr	4	He must have planted bugs in the rafters , in my bedroom , in the kitchen ; or slipped trackers in my shoes .
tr	4	 They taste as good as they run ,  he laughed between hearty bites of meat and potatoes to everyone 's entertainment .
tr	4	Joshua couldn 't even see his family now , only knew they were somewhere at the bottom of the hill .
tr	4	Veiled in the blue aura of the moonlight mist , a gargantuan temple of grey stone stands among the massive trees .
te	4	He flew down to the cement floor in his hot spy glamour , much to the awe of the clients .
tr	4	Indeed , we imprisoned a number of human beings , invaders all , to try to pry the knowledge from them .
tr	4	When they arrived , he was still bound , gagged , and tied to a wheelchair in the medical device aisle .
te	4	Without thinking about what she was going , Susan drew her own pistol the next time the lights flickered off .

tr	4	Jansen felt himself sliding down along the wedge that was holding him and he sank to his haunches as his gaze hit the ground .
tr	4	"Joseph thought this over and then he said : "" Yes , the Lord will take care of us , you 're right ."

tr	4	As if someone pulled a plug and let all the air out of the room , everyone released their breath in one big sigh .

tr	4	Clearly exhausted , the weakened citizens and fatigued guardsmen soldier on , finding some unknown source of determination within themselves .

va	4	 It 's Mike , and no , we have sheds and barns and strong backs to help those that can build houses .

tr	4	The next morning , to his delight , all of the food was gone from the tray and the garbage drums were still locked .
va	4	He swooped low and as he passed they looked up , some even pointing as he carried himself away on the winds .

tr	4	I heard a buzz , turning my head I could see a type of generator that seemed to provide power to the whole camp .
tr	4	 I 'm going to the end of the tunnel and back , this wall is where it should be , right ? 
tr	4	He took in the Prince 's clothing , the heavy way in which he was breathing , and then seemed to make a decision .
te	4	He sat in the chair to which the Seeker had motioned , and wondered idly why he did not feel relieved .

tr	4	 You know they can 't resist trying to blow their own mistakes out of proportion and then pin it on some patsy .

tr	4	" No , Rick , it simply changes the molecular state of the objects you place into it to air .

tr	4	 Father , we should get up ; the floor is too cold to sit on for any length of time .

va	4	No attempt had been made to hide the working parts of the machine , exposing bolts , chains and cogs .
tr	4	Loc reached around the back of his neck until he found the comm bud that had become dislodged on impact .
tr	4	We don 't know how many villains we 're dealing with in Brixton so we 'd have to be prepared for the worst .
te	4	A battered blue motorcycle leaned against a sleek banana plant , and a gaggle of scraggly chickens pecked lazily in the powdery dirt .
tr	4	His face remains shrouded in the dark , but she can picture its stoic state in her mind easily enough .
tr	4	They seem to communicate through inexplicable noises and gestures as they form a perimeter around the prison and prepare to move out across Hyrule .
tr	4	It had taken Jeff 's forces two days to root out the diehard remnants of Vella 's supporters from San Felipe de Morro .
tr	4	He had wondered too just what some of those fireworks he had liberated from his art teacher 's storage unit actually did .
tr	4	I didn 't want to turn around to see who called me , continuing what I started , namely to get in my room .
tr	4	He quietly let himself out of the house and started to make his way around the perimeter of the property .
tr	4	 With Forrest Reed gone , and this show the only remaining source of creative commentary , what will happen ? 
va	4	Two swarthy men stood nearby with thick bundles of car radio antennas taped together , clearly to beat anyone who refused to maintain order .
tr	4	I can hardly wait to teach them all I know , about the sea , the land , about people .
tr	4	Don 't want to see any more , want to leave here ... The press loosened as they passed through the doors .
te	4	It was no easy task to project menus and needs months in advance but eventually I worked out a list I hoped would suffice .
tr	4	Electricity was crackling in the air all around us , the power undulating , vibrating back and forth , bouncing all around the room .
va	4	When you wake you will find your rifle and pistols missing , their elements have been merged and forged into an indispensable blade .
va	4	They brought it with them from across the sea , and when they settled here that power began to dim .
tr	4	With the help of friends they were able to extricate themselves from the crowd and make their way over to the horse and buggy .
va	4	There were thick bruises around her neck and along her face , as well as poorly healed cuts on her scalp .
tr	4	Each of her words spreads perfume and music and she asks Please , learned one , will you help us ?
tr	4	Light from a nearby security lamp flickered through the swaying curtains and cast moving shadows across the ceiling and walls of the bedroom .

tr	4	He said it was hardship having almost no electricity or fuel and they were living practically in the Stone Age but were getting by .
tr	4	This was a five star restaurant , and the average bill for two people was close to six hundred dollars .
tr	4	Tears ran down the champion 's eyes as he absently hacked his victims and thought of his love and their begotten .
tr	4	We will take it slow , learn first what the situation is and then I will decide how to proceed .
tr	4	Sarah sometimes allowed the unthinkable to appear in her thoughts , like a dangerous enemy she was always on the look-out for .
tr	4	 You had a fourth place finish just a week ago -- that 's two points ,  Alex pointed out .
tr	4	But those are the only painful or difficult things I remember , and I won 't tell of them now .
tr	4	The Hub was impressive , but with no character or soul , it was hardly an inspirational place to live .
te	4	 Hello Abe , everything 's going pretty well so far , knock on wood ... how about you , feeling OK ? 
tr	4	A man in a black suit , with sunglasses and an ear piece , had come in and started silently watching over them .
tr	4	" I think God 's wondering how long it 'll take before we get up and go look for him .
tr	4	Sarah felt a catch in her throat as she watched her boy , so resolute , so sure of himself .
tr	4	She hoped to find a clue in town , or a piece of information that would lead them further down the trail .
tr	4	But it was beyond even her usually hopeful imagination to believe that the day would end with their arms around their beloved one .
tr	4	It wouldn 't have mattered if she hadn 't been lost in her thoughts when the sound of the thunder crashed down on them .
tr	4	Julie slipped out of the bed , peeling the dirty sheets back and trying to ignore if anything moved or crawled as she moved .
tr	4	 Sorry , "" she said , slipping back into bed , careful not to let her cold feet touch his ."
va	4	Once they were down he hooked his thumbs into the pistol belt of his military combat uniform which he was now grateful he wore .
tr	4	Then he looked back to the squirming Jimmy , who was unsuccessfully trying to pull his hand free of Mark 's herculean grip .
tr	4	Tears of relief drip down my face , or maybe it 's terror , or some strange , sad mixture .
tr	4	The Prince , somewhat irked that his question had been disregarded , nevertheless heeled his horse in the ribs and shot after them .
tr	4	Link doesn 't notice the bitter taste of grass brushing against his lips , or the haunting sound of creaking trees overhead .
va	4	I tied up a bag of rubbish and carried it to the disposal container at the rear of the property .
tr	4	I had fervently hoped that Olsson would be amongst them : there were some burning questions I needed to ask my old friend .
tr	4	It was Old Sarah 's grandfather who had built this pool , we were told , when he settled in Nazareth .
tr	4	It contained a makeshift bed and he could see a few sprigs of holly had been placed around to brighten the otherwise sparse space .
tr	4	There was a heavy crunching sound , and the dark figure came out of the shadows and into the torchlight .
tr	4	Then beneath the pain something grew -- flashes of emotion that were not her own , memories she had never lived .
tr	4	I told him of our situation and asked if he had any idea where the closest people might be to us ?
tr	4	The weapon mounts , their housings and the bulkheads of the entire region around the main battery had optic fibers embedded in them .
va	4	One could postulate that this hesitation was natural in a bridegroom who had not met his betrothed and had little knowledge of her .
tr	4	He told her of the necklace and that it was to be given to Octavian today , but they did not know how .
tr	4	She pressed upon a gold ornament in the wall , and a panel swung inward , disclosing an ivory stair leading upward .
tr	4	 The only fantasy nuts I know are asleep right now , but I 'll do that tonight ,  Abby promised .
tr	4	The bed looked like someone had used a knife to shave off the outside wood , and it was covered with plain white sheets .
tr	4	 Your teeth are so perfect ,  she whispered and reached up a trembling finger to trace his lips .
va	4	I clenched the flashlight in my teeth and kept peering down , but the ladder didn 't seem to end .
tr	4	' Possibly ' , he said , ' but I don 't have the finances to take the gamble ' .
tr	4	As we disembarked at the Coast Guard dock , there was another larger explosion in the distance and Castle Morro fell silent .
tr	4	I couldn 't look down for long because my stomach felt queasy and vertigo hit me like a sugar high .
tr	4	The only way to reach the deserted site was up a narrow , rutted track lined with thick undergrowth and crowded by trees .
tr	4	He caught the shocked expression on both images ' faces for a split second before they disappeared into the underbrush .
tr	4	I know that doesn 't absolve me , or make it okay to be the pest of a shocked and mute person .
tr	4	Removing the lid he opened up the oily package to reveal the Browning High Power issued to him so many years before .
te	4	We were faced with a narrow hallway that opened onto a long , cramped corridor suffused with the smell of cooking and cheap disinfectant .
tr	4	 Father 's in his study , and Mother went to town to order a new dress ,  he replied .
tr	4	She merely walked up to me and started to introduce herself to me while she placed her hand on my arm .
tr	4	' It 's good to see you looking so well , ' he said to Tomas Godard , who stood at the side .
tr	4	I stared at Victor for a long time before rising from the table and stepping to the edge of the veranda .
tr	4	Jules would throw the money on his growing pile and a few hundred workers would be looking for new jobs .

te	4	Some indentations were deep , some were shallow , and all were spaced unevenly over the entire false rock face .
tr	4	He crossed the distance to the Prince and placed two enormous hands on his shoulders , nearly engulfing his head .
tr	4	After four of those , it is no surprise that she sees death as another avenue of escape , maybe the only one .
tr	4	Hot fingers grabbed his temple like a vise , twisting his head to one side , plastering one cheek against the icy concrete .
tr	4	 It just kind a seemed like the right thing to do ... the only thing to do really . 
te	4	No one knows how large the nation is , though the population has varied throughout the reign of the Empress .
tr	4	He crossed to it - and saw the sixth golden coin , and a mixed wave of relief and anger coursed through him .
tr	4	Trans Central was one monument , all linked together to create an appearance of complete unity ; a beacon for people to aspire .
tr	4	They seemed to be curious about me , and they came up to the bank by me and just watched me watching them .
tr	4	Her heart broke then and she felt herself staring at him , pale in the moonlight streaming through the window .
tr	4	 We have to look at this mess sooner or later ,  he fought for encouragement for the both of them .
tr	4	 Luckily we didn 't start to climb up , or he would have had us arrested and thrown in prison . 
tr	4	Fierce as she is , Shireen still has her dreamy Persian notions -- that love is more important than money or duty or religion .

tr	4	 Hey beautiful ,  he wrapped his arm around her from behind and kissed her softly on the neck .
te	4	And then , on sudden impulse , he took a step forward , drawing the dagger she 'd lent him .
tr	4	I could see them in my mind , the two women hugging each other when last we 'd been together .
tr	4	He lifted the long , thin veils and lowered his head just a little as he stepped under the spine of the gable .

te	4	Adele continued in the task of cooling Finan , a slight furrow between her brows as she considered his question .
tr	4	But his apathy only increased her petulance and she went on with the rant with even more vehemence than before .
te	4	Unable to move , speak or even think he just sat there , waiting for his love to return and release the spell .
tr	4	 Hmmm , ok , only if he will have fun  she said with a disgusting smile , running in her room .
tr	4	The fact was , after weeks of observing them , she did know which clouds spelled snow and which ones didn 't .
tr	4	There was an oil lamp burning inside , he could smell it , and see the warm glow in the smoky glass shade .
tr	4	But he 'd disappear for most of the day without comment , and when present , a dark cloud hung about the man .

te	4	Din 's presence subdued for the time being , he simply revels in his successful occupation of the castle once again .

tr	4	I thought to myself of all the promises I had ever made this was the one I most dearly wished to keep .
tr	4	"For instance , what was found in Houston when you opened the room where Lasher had been keeping me ? """
tr	4	Though the king of thieves would see this trait as weakness to be exploited , Mai observes it as a sort of unaltered purity .
va	4	As quietly as she could , she went to the doorway and looked in , but the room was deserted .
tr	4	Gunnar searched around , looking for any trace of where they had left to , but he found no clues .
tr	4	Feeling faint , she crawled in slow motion under the canvas tarps Gabriel had pointed out and tried not to move .
tr	4	Adele 's back was to the tree , Rafe 's breathing heavy in her ear as he scanned the darkness over her shoulder .
tr	4	The two projectiles had met at a combined speed of almost twenty thousand kilometers per hour and little more than vapor remained .
tr	4	She hadn 't seen Simon or Neil for days ; neither had she caught a glimpse of Uncle Virgil or Aunt Theodosia .
va	4	Clancy , good as his word had a roaring blaze within minutes and the others gathered about to ward off the night 's chill .
tr	4	Reclining in a rocking chair , the middle-aged man taps his thumb upon his shovel , speared into the ground next to him .
tr	4	I ran along the perimeter of the Extravaganza then rushed up to the door of the bakery and jerked the knob back and forth .
tr	4	She didn 't let his wariness affect her , keeping her tone light and strolling as if she were in a sunlit meadow .
tr	4	"Even today , I have no reservations about you or the firm , I hope you hold none against me . """
tr	4	Faint sounds of beating hooves began to invade the sound of his breath and the crunch of twigs and leaves .
tr	4	 For the simple fact that you make Laurence smile again , to actually remember why he is living . 
tr	4	Iseo feared he would move toward her too quickly , but he regaled her with the political tale of the day .
tr	4	" The tents have been reconstructed on the other side of the camp , joining our camp with Rand 's .
tr	4	If you do not know the rage in their hearts over this atrocity , you will soon see its effects . "
tr	4	 Any food and building material your kingdom can spare will be much appreciated as we have suffered an attack of our own . 
tr	4	The following would not be possible without the creativity and vision of the well-known individuals responsible for the source material .
va	4	she spat and skipped to the oversized couch , where she plunged over the back and settled face-down just within reach of the remote .
tr	4	When he saw her look up at him he smiled and nodded then went to the back and opened the tailgate .
tr	4	The image of her feet , skin worn away to a bloody pulp from walking , her slippers torn , is engraved in me .
tr	4	"When he stalked out , the arrogant bastard called out behind him , "" I will have my turn . """
tr	4	"She was the first person I met from your guild , and she 's been assigned to be our guide . """
tr	4	Precious moments were lost while Farmer pulled the recorder unit out of their luggage to return triumphantly to the passenger cabin .
tr	4	He had one hand on the stretched belly and one hand under her face , the pouty lips warm and inviting .
tr	4	Reaching in he took out two handguns , his SIG 9 mill and the Browning High Power which he passed to Robbie .
tr	4	he explained very coolly , calmly , betraying his own fears only by the way his hand clutched his wounded leg .
tr	4	Cade shook his head as he leaned over to cut a section of Darin 's tunic off and dipped it in the brook .
tr	4	What was most unusual in England was that he had a ' license to carry ' a function of the security services he provided .
va	4	He 'll be a good leader , when the time comes , and his friend with him -- what 's his name ?
tr	4	Connie decided to return to the boat and prepare lunch ; she was either going to bring it back or pick me up .
te	4	There was no breeze , the sun was only just rising in the east , and everything was back to normal .
tr	4	Fighting to regain control , he lets out a roar of desperation as the entire room is consumed with a blinding light .
tr	4	The largest looked like it had been drawn from above , with numbers placed at various points around the wreck .
tr	4	she had felt for the longest time that she must have done something wrong , that somehow she had caused offence .
te	4	 I 'll take it ,  she smirks , releasing his nose and propping her forearms on top of his head .
tr	4	The ship that had been straining against her bonds these past few minutes now seemed to have had second thoughts about entering the sea .
tr	4	Rob finally answered just as Rick came back , satisfied with a picture to send , which he quickly loaded for her .
tr	4	Ariel who documented all my adventures -- and as far as she was concerned , I 've never lost a battle .
tr	4	Before long , it got louder , sometimes interrupted by shouts or curses as one man tried to convince another .
tr	4	A litany of Czech issued from the other end of the line : I recognised several choice expletives and winced .
te	4	Paul Campbell did what he was told to do , and he would continue to do so as long as Ethan held his son .
tr	4	I grab the necklace from where I keep it hidden under my bed , lock myself in my bathroom , and cry .
tr	4	The main gist seemed to be glory and praise to Allah , and at the end she heard something about Satan .
va	4	He was ' the traveler ' , the only one by which news of the outside ever reached their lands .
tr	4	" Sometimes one here or there will get his own ideas about stuff , but it almost always ends badly , you know ?
tr	4	Anyway , he was trying to get to that old deer salt lick and didn 't think things through , you know ? "
tr	4	Beau realized he had that old familiar energy and focus flooding through him now and he rejoiced in his heart despite the dire situation .
tr	4	The Daemons will run amok with no one controlling them , but they won 't be much use in any tactical planning after that .
tr	4	Cade didn 't notice , now wiping off the black steel blade with the rag and tossing it back to its owner .
tr	4	Stepping toward the building 's ledge , he pulled off his backpack and sat down , leaning against the short wall .
tr	4	She had a stack of folders in her arms and was reaching distractedly for the access badge at her waist .
tr	4	They wouldn 't go home until they knew the person was going to be okay , so neither would she .
tr	4	The girls were more likely in the same grade as the younger boys , but Dave and Rob got there first .
tr	4	As they rounded a boulder completely covered in snow and ice , she spoke again , her voice misting in the air .
tr	4	As he moved over to one side in order to pass , the runner in black moved over as if to block him .
tr	4	With that said , I understand the importance of bringing all our resources to bear during this time of crisis .
tr	4	His face was framed with golden waves of hair that shone like the sun even in the night with an insistent and hypnotizing luminescence .
tr	4	" Of course I do minister ,  he stammered , "" But -- "" "" Then you will take us to the king ."
tr	4	He did not ride in the carriage , where all his things were ; a knight rode horses , by definition .
va	4	He had simply walked over to the table of the two Israeli diplomats while playing a violin piece and detonated the explosives .
va	4	The horses cantered off out of sight , leaving the Prince alone with twenty-three dead Defenders lying on the ground .
tr	4	Why they must remain segregated from the world of light due to the actions of their malevolent ancestors in past centuries .
tr	4	Unsure how to react , the duo duck for cover when the hero 's broadsword rockets between them like a whirling propeller .
tr	4	Alejo noticed Gabriel was carrying a purple backpack that obviously didn 't belong to him , which he carelessly slung to the ground .
tr	4	She took the food with a nod and held it as he did , rotating to keep the juices soaking into the bread .
tr	4	"You came south , in an attempt to find a Seeker ... and in doing so delivered yourself up for slaughter . """
tr	4	King Ine was not really attending to him anymore , but was staring at the missive in his hand in great perplexity .
va	4	It is high praise indeed coming from one such as you , but I am in need of your advice .
tr	4	 All kidding aside , I feel like I haven 't really told you ,  she pauses , trying to find the words .
tr	4	 Well , I got ta ' do a ton of work on the websites anyway ,  Gabe says .
tr	4	"It does indeed , "" he said while throwing sheets of paper in the air ; tossing books and files to one side ."
va	4	~ Their eyes needed little time to adjust from the bright sunshine outside to the brilliant overhead lights inside the boathouse .
tr	4	It directly addresses the important question of who we are as a species , and our presence and purpose on Earth .
tr	4	They had spent more of his visits in conversation together , and she had felt her admiration grow to become slightly different .
va	4	I watched quickly the phone , and after the 20 calls and messages from my mother , the time was ten pm .
tr	4	He had a better life here , with his mother 's family just down the hill and Liam 's sister at this cottage .
tr	4	I walk with purpose into Amber 's room and gaze at the picture of the cheerleaders giggling behind their pompoms .
tr	4	"He said , "" You don 't know how much , I put in a request for this assignment . """
tr	4	What I loved the most about that room was the window in the ceiling , which was a little inclined after the ceiling form .
tr	4	Raj with the weight of yesterday 's incident still on his shoulders began to move with a heavy tread towards her room .
tr	4	There had been something very defenseless about the way Mana had been sitting in the cart beside the drunken , singing driver .
tr	4	 Hi , Tommy , look ,  Billy lifted his hands and up jumped a large black cat from the carriage .
tr	4	The man kneeling across from her , who seemed to be in charge , passed his hand across his brow before he spoke .
tr	4	" Actually , you 'll inherit former Lieutenant , now Captain , Jason Green and his men from Fort Campbell .
tr	4	So assuming Captain Green is successful in his mission , we only have to worry about the northern area . "
va	4	This is the closest to happy I 've seen him , and it makes him handsome even with the scar .
tr	4	" So ... this group had given Alfred grief a year earlier when they learned NET was interested in buying Jacob 's business .
tr	4	Alfred speculated that perhaps they felt that with Jacob 's business in their backyard , they would be able to siphon off some technology .
tr	4	One thing , he certainly wouldn 't tell us if anything shady was going on , but he might have told Jacob . "
tr	4	 It sounds like you 're well on your way ,  said Alfred , patting him on the arm .
va	4	I really didn 't even know that each day wasn 't supposed to be filled with new , strange things , he thought .
tr	4	 I should get some food first , all those coffee packs are eating a hole through my stomach . 
tr	4	Hopping down the massive individual steps , Rift reaches the base of the floating island , suspended by some unknown force .
va	4	 Don 't kill people unless I have to ,  she said quietly , piercing him with her green eyes .
tr	4	A lieutenant hovered behind her , waiting to take his seat if she managed to talk him into leaving the CIC .
tr	4	Not wanting to play the ocarina until he knows just how close Link is , he holds it near his lips , squinting downward .
tr	4	Miriam stole a look at Simon 's grim profile , sighed slightly and tried to shift into a more comfortable position .
tr	4	The shuttles were controlled by operators on board the Ares , reconciling the target assignments with whatever data was available about the enemy ships .
tr	4	"If this works , his social development will advance rapidly , and he ' ll need you more than ever . """
tr	4	 He 's barely old enough to shave every day ,  he replied , voice calm , measured and quiet .
tr	4	He then untied the rope from his waist and tied it off to a column before pulling himself back to the pool .
tr	4	" At least we 're in the dry season ,  said Peter , "" not that it helped them too much . """
tr	4	 Surely even you must see that visiting harm upon Adele is a vastly different thing to visiting harm upon me ! 
tr	4	 You just can 't tell a gypsy something like that , that his oldest friend 's been run over by some maniac . 
va	4	The Lost Woods are as familiar as the back of his hand , but he has journeyed much deeper than ever before .
te	4	After checking in and after an excellent meal he settled in the lounge bar to while away the rest of the evening .
tr	4	Chapter 5 Wisdom and Truth Iseo felt the heat rise on the back of her neck , causing her to turn around .
tr	4	He 'd dream of a son or a daughter in his arms when there was a real chance of it .
tr	4	By ' lay off , ' I mean ' shoot in the face and bury in a mass grave . '
tr	4	Chris nodded back , remembering he 'd promised to take her to Barney 's this afternoon to check out the animals .
tr	4	' Had Balthazar not stolen her heart , I had hoped the two of you would marry one day . '
tr	4	More of his own accord than because of her order , Rift releases Zelda and begins to walk toward the Queen of Twilight .
tr	4	" That is why you wanted me to trust you so much , and now I am glad I did .
tr	4	Pierre had managed to get her a pair of shoes to protect her feet but she was flopping in them .
tr	4	Standing at the corner of the tavern , he inhaled deeply at the gravity of not being able to see them again .
tr	4	Pierre and Nora were smitten with each other , walking along the beach just talking about everything , holding hands .
tr	4	Nora was happy about his new assignment and told him as much , enjoying the young Captain 's closeness and tenderness since they met .
tr	4	When he returned her to her hut , he had a difficult time leaving her but he wanted to do right by her .
tr	4	Their nights were filled with bliss and he took her in his arms and loved her without any pressure or lingering uncertainty .
tr	4	They spent a week with Nora 's family , who were relieved and glad that she was alive and well .
tr	4	When she relaxed with him she blossomed under his loving attention , giving herself to the man she loved in an orgasmic euphoria .
tr	4	For two days , they were not seen as Pierre indulged himself in the little lady with the heated passion .
tr	4	Nora was a well-bred lady who , after the ordeal and in his tender care , became a vibrant young woman .
tr	4	He had turned into a responsible , hard-working man that loved the sea , a man her father would be proud of .
tr	4	There was no doubt in his mind , but meeting this brave man he had heard of so many times made him worry .
tr	4	He scowled and he pulled her closer , leaning over the sleeping form and kissing her , demanding attention from her sleepy form .
tr	4	Since then she had gotten used to her very tender husband and she pushed him back softly , not to alarm him .
tr	4	Her eyes blinked in the dark to take him in and she whispered ,  Hey , what is wrong ? """
tr	4	 He 'll go to school in the mornings , as all the boys do ,  Joseph went on .
te	4	" I know 007 tries to be funny , but it didn 't occur to him that I 'm brain damaged too .
tr	4	 I 'd like to try talking to William through 007 , "" said Toby a twinkle in his eye ."
tr	4	These were accepted readily and taught others how to process food , cure and tan leather , and safely deliver babies among other things .
tr	4	 Don 't worry Connie , I 'll get you out of this hellhole , how long have they held you ? 
tr	4	He watched John pull the stick from the goo and sniff it before letting it drip back into the pot .
tr	4	The girl at the other end of the chain on his wrist was now ignoring them both , or pretending to .
tr	4	The man started to retort with a smart reply and then looked down at the military identification card and paused .
tr	4	Putting him on hold he quickly bought David , who was El Campo 's ruler over the Christmas period ' up to speed ' .
te	4	Its blade was straight , unlike her katana 's curved one , and the hand guards were long and thin .
tr	4	I struggled to sit , ignoring the voices telling me to be still as I continued to look around the room .
tr	4	For the first time in a long time , the cobwebs in my mind cleared , and I felt purpose .
tr	4	"Putting the filler spout into the fuel tank he gestured to Taylor , "" Would you mind firing up the pump , son ? """
tr	4	At that the man laughed and he headed right towards my father and my uncles , and they took hold of him .
tr	4	 We 'll mix in carbon fiber to give added strength to the concrete , in case the heat causes it to crack . 
tr	4	He looked sad and tired as he spoke , he was obviously far more affected by the loss than he liked to make out .
tr	4	Concepts like love and hatred blended together in her mind , both of them equally perplexing in their irrational ways .
tr	4	I took a look and sure enough there was a hose bib , Sam turned it on and water came gushing out .
tr	4	Soon , he stood in front of a wooden door , like all the other wooden doors he had passed along the way .
tr	4	The Captain removed the electronic card from the top of the confiscated goods and put it back in his pocket .
te	4	there 's even a sort of shrine thing at one end ... ... there 's a bloody skull on it for Christ 's sake !
te	4	Alejo had been so obsessed with Salazar he 'd paid no attention to the Prism funders ' reaction to Marco 's death .
tr	4	She turned and used the person 's momentum to deflect the dagger someone had been trying to get to her with from behind .
tr	4	 Get the major stakeholders lined up for a meeting at the UN and make sure my schedule is cleared . 
tr	4	Bringing it back to his room , he put the glass on his nightstand and dropped the hunk of metal into it .
tr	4	My body followed the momentum of the tram , whipping backwards and smashing the back of my head against my headrest .
tr	4	She had read them so often that she knew them by heart , but still they evoked in her a sense of belonging .
tr	4	John used his finger to dig gunk out of his dog 's eyes before wiping it on his pant leg .
tr	4	After all , is Christ Our Lord not the ultimate supernatural hero , the ultimate outsider , the ultimate immortal of them all ?
va	4	She closed her eyes , willing the drink to calm her and not open up the floodgates of emotion as was all too likely .
va	4	It took him forever to turn his head to Elaina , who was falling at fraction of the normal speed , holding her throat .
va	4	Trae saw the brakes release from the old Buick , then quickly stop again , almost as if by accident .
tr	4	The woman closed her eyes this time , as if , unable to leave , she would allow herself to feel this appropriately .
tr	4	For a moment there was silence between them as he tried to think of the best way to broach the subject .
tr	4	"Chapter 15 Lost to Love "" This makes two days in a row you summon me to your chamber , "" Iseo remarked ."
tr	4	the Prince called back , cutting down a man who had forced his way forward , but leaving him alive .
tr	4	" She 's bound to find out eventually ,  he thought , "" so I might as well tell her ... ... ."
tr	4	They 'll dig to see if there 's a keel , but even if that 's gone , it doesn 't really prove anything .
tr	4	 I didn 't decide to execute that man out there , David ,  she said in a loud whisper .
tr	4	 It 's just , I feel weird , you know ,  Gabriel sighed , still batting at the stupid mosquito .
tr	4	They were too far to make out much detail , but enough I could tell there was a sprinkling of warships among them .
tr	4	Some twenty feet above the ground to my left , perched on a ledge next to a fire escape , was a silver tabby .
tr	4	Valerian sat dumbly , watching the man in whose slim hands , the pirate realized , his destiny now rested .
va	4	Unfortunately , it was moving ever further from the capital city and toward an area that had seen some of the heaviest fighting .
tr	4	 Mr. Clancy , have you been ...  He grabbed Clancy and began dragging him back into the woods .
tr	4	But as he peeked his head above the dune , Chris smiled to see his hours of hard work come to fruition .
te	4	The beer was cold and had a pleasant hops and malt taste , not overpowering but definitely a delight for the palate .
te	4	She responds , appearing atop the boy 's shoulders once again , leaning forward to study his face beneath his new hood .
va	4	He had avoided her the entire time they were in the village , and now he wondered why he had done that .
tr	4	Proudly she sat in the long boat , shoulders straight , as Fausto took the oars and started to row away from the ship .
tr	4	Didn 't last long and the nurse told us that the visiting is over , so we had to leave .
tr	4	After surviving the fiasco of the formal dinner , he had relaxed in Mana 's company and was actually enjoying himself .
tr	4	You can visit my website to contact me , read more of my work or follow the link to my FaceBook page .
tr	4	I remained somewhat in touch with the outside world through radio and listened as conditions grew grimmer by the day .
te	4	The creature shakes with rage , its bulky , humanoid body topped with a large mask concealing its entire head .
tr	4	 Your ship is stranded out of time , Walker ,  he whispered , his voice somewhere between a growl and a purr .
tr	4	 Oh my God , Abby , we have to take you to a hospital and to call the police . 
tr	4	Walking aimlessly through the indiscernible area , Rift pauses when he hears the distinct sound of falling sand to his left .
tr	4	The furniture was sparse and utilitarian ; whatever there was of it looked antique Bohemian , old but in good condition .
te	4	"I am your dad and any guy is crazy if he doesn 't see how great a catch you are . """
va	4	Finally all had recovered from the illness , even Little Esther for whom we 'd feared the worst just because she was little .
tr	4	 I want us to be friends again if we could ,  he answered , after what was a long pause .
tr	4	" I don 't doubt that , although he had no family to speak of -- just his ideas and his money .
tr	4	I wasn 't there , but Fuchs felt strongly enough to issue a challenge , and the game was on .
tr	4	Our train had left Rome without incident , and the rest of that afternoon was spent admiring the passing countryside .
tr	4	In every passing tree , drops of dew were falling towards the ground , creating a false sense of rain .
tr	4	Fleeing from danger and fighting it when the chance had arisen , we had formed a fast bond , the three of us .
tr	4	Along the horizon , a range of mountains loomed above the train , casting its majestic shadow over the land .
tr	4	One moment , the scenery was an idyllic picture of country living , and the next , buildings of every size surrounded us .
tr	4	If Mercedes ' father was anything like his other relatives , our visit would be enjoyable as well as informative .
tr	4	We watched him come up to you , and as he reached out to tap you , I turned to Jacob .
tr	4	The sooner we find out about this Faith cult , the better it 'll be for all of us ,  I said ."
tr	4	Although Nathan didn 't use the offered fuel to drive home , he hadn 't hesitated to use the telephone .
va	4	And now , miracle of miracles , even at his height , he did not stand out so very much .
te	4	I couldn 't put my finger on it , but there was definitely a hint of deception behind that harmless grin .
tr	4	Chris saw that only Sykes seemed ostracized , sitting alone with his arms crossed away from the rest of the crew .
va	4	As she dodged rocks left and right she caught sight of Jeff just in time to see him take a rock to the shoulder .
tr	4	In the end , it took a private phone call from the President himself to stop the county commander from arresting us .
te	4	He walked over to her and slapped her so hard that her head bounced back , slamming into the man who held her .
te	4	 I can 't believe I 'm doing this ,  he muttered , then whirled the gun 's chamber shut .
va	4	Even someone from the other side of the world understood -- they didn 't go by choice , and those stories never ended well .
tr	4	She rose from her haunches and lashed her hideous tail , snapping off saplings as if they had been toothpicks .
tr	4	The bright blue exhaust created short plumes as the fission fragments were magnetically channeled away from the reaction at incredibly high temperatures .
tr	4	This time the sound was deeper and the single line of fire streaked more slowly towards the ground but it was still deceptively fast .
tr	4	 Not now ,  she said quietly as she turned him , none too gently , towards the door .
tr	4	And some deep , awful grief in Yuri was touched suddenly , disastrously perhaps , by the warm , sympathetic voice of this man .
tr	4	"Lie down and let me rub your back , God you 're so tense your muscles are like iron bars . """
te	4	"You are an honorable man , and I 'm certain you will respect the sacred laws of our country . """
va	4	The other girl punched the ball ahead of her and kept running forward with no enemies around , but closing in fast .

tr	4	"One rider dismounted and followed Lady Adele 's tracks , the other took both horses and returned from whence he came . """
te	4	One thing struck me as odd ; Ensign Jackson had never met the radio operator we had been communicating with .
tr	4	" You don 't understand what you are , but if you did , I think you would forgive me .
tr	4	I let out a guttural moan that is wholly inadequate to express just how obliterated the little planet of Maya is .
tr	4	This is when the word monster first seizes in my mind -- a seed plugged into fertile agony to germinate later .
tr	4	 Hey , "" Gabe says , "" I know you 're tired , but I want to show you something . """
tr	4	Victoria , and Toby to a limited degree , participated in this round as they all enjoyed the pasta and homemade bread .
tr	4	There wasn 't a sound from the hallway , so she slipped out into the hall and crept down the stairs .
tr	4	Butch smiled at him in gratitude while Anderson tilted his head and looked back at Reggie with a knowing smile .
tr	4	With quick , sure steps , I marched across the small side yard to the backyard not even glancing at the henhouse .
tr	4	Neil opened his mouth to ask her about this phenomenon , but Riki forestalled him with a hand on his sleeve .
tr	4	He retrieved the necessary tools and work gloves out of the shed and hurried up the small hill to the designated trees .
tr	4	With Raj , I just wanted to be with him because in him I saw some goodness that I had seldom seen in others .
tr	4	The cavern is not naturally formed , the walls forming right angles every time a hallway turns or meets an intersection .
tr	4	She picked up her bag and started towards the low stone wall separating the pasture from the grounds of a thatched , stone cottage .
tr	4	 We can do it when we 're safe away from here ,  the Prince insisted , feeling she was being completely unreasonable .
tr	4	He closed the adjustment needles all the way and then counted out loud the number of revolutions while he opened them back up .
tr	4	Before he had gotten four steps he heard a low throaty growl behind him and knew he was about to find out anyway .
tr	4	" Here you are , the sherry that you wanted , and Mr. Furnace will be along directly with the port and the champagne .
tr	4	 All I know is that I had to move all the furniture in Miss Miriam 's room , "" George said ."
te	4	"I will cleanse my heart and set my feet upon the path of righteous tasks to serve God , "" Celestino vowed ."
tr	4	Leah burst into the clearing not a minute later , once more clothed , and without hesitation jumped onto her horse .
tr	4	Watching them , Miriam thought with a rising tide of exultation that Mana was wrong ; they were all pretty stupid .
tr	4	They would have eventually found willing prisoners who could catch them up on technologies such as guns and sailing vessels .
tr	4	But my momma taught me that another man 's religion was like another man 's wife -- none of my goddamn business .
tr	4	It 's true , I 've had the privilege of molding young minds , and that 's a legacy I 'm proud of .
tr	4	Suddenly , as he passed her , the librarian 's hand shot out at a speed seemingly impossible for a man of his age .
tr	4	The Questionable had been christened in ' 57 , only two decades earlier , and Ward was proudly riding Queen Victoria 's favorite ship .
tr	4	Two more arrows scream through the air in rapid succession , fired from some unseen location at the room 's perimeter .
tr	4	"What matters to me is that you can sing ; I shall not put a musical talent to waste . """
va	4	The sun is setting , and he will not waste another moment licking his wounds so long as sages yet live .
va	4	I haven 't written anything since that night except for imaginary letters asking for a forgiveness I will never earn .
tr	4	Staring back down at the ship , it was easy to imagine what she might have looked like in her day .
tr	4	A tornado of focused flame blasts from the ninja 's concealed face , nearly knocking the cringing hero over with the force alone .
tr	4	There was a thin red line on the side of her shoulder , just enough to cut through her shirt and knick her skin .
tr	4	Although they were heavily outnumbered and overmatched in weapons , Nathan thought they just might be able to pull this off .
te	4	And we 'll go up to Jerusalem and there at the Feasts , maybe he 'll listen to the teachers in the Temple .
tr	4	Both knew it was time to get out of there before the man got it in his head to sound the alarm .
tr	4	She was covered in dust and dirt , and there was a small red line of dried blood on her shoulder .
tr	4	Not for the first time , he was glad of the brevet ranks that Colonel McCutcheon had arranged for them .
va	4	There were three and a half boxes of shells for the deer rifles and two for the pistol but none for the assault rifle .
te	4	The other three turned to see Hunt up on the hill waving his arms gesturing for them to join him .
tr	4	This was proof that the government had murdered an innocent woman and they were involved in a lie to cover it up .
tr	4	Anatole waved from behind the wheels of the leading SUV ; Victor nodded stoically from the seat next to him .
tr	4	His tone was the only indication of his disapproval , the closest he 'd ever come to speaking against orders .
tr	4	Slowly he eased back , trying not to pull or flick his shoulder , and then he closed his eyes .
tr	4	The arrow to her thigh is no cause for concern , but the two in her abdomen are draining the animal 's strength rapidly .
tr	4	 It 's too dark now , and we don 't want to trample any evidence by accident ,  another officer said .
va	4	Chapter 2 God of Stone and Spirit Years had passed since Father Tomas had beheld the wonder of a gargoyle in his sanctuary .

tr	5	He stayed in this place where the other stallions surrounded him with fire coming out of their nostrils and fear for the first time swept over Scarborough .
tr	5	 I 've built a wee fire ,  he said , indicating with a jerk of his head the backcourt on the side of the barn .

tr	5	 Okay , girls , it 's time to leave the room  George said as he picked up the sack he 'd brought from the pharmacy .
tr	5	Still he continued to push himself , focusing on each individual step as the bitter chill cut into his skin like millions of microscopic icicles .
te	5	He tried imitating her facial expression , but it felt strange on his mouth , so he let it fall away before Iseo looked up .
tr	5	Did she think we were only going to do little girl things , or did she hope rich Claire would take poor little Sky shopping ?
tr	5	 I 'm talking about our plans to take the war to the gods  , she said , running her finger over the map of hell .
tr	5	"Just wanted to have a little bed-and-breakfast to keep me busy , and keep me fed , after my husband died , "" Mrs. Davis said ."
tr	5	His cheeks were ruddy from the weather , and his eyes were ablaze with a deep passion for the concepts and ideas he was expressing .
tr	5	At first she stared around her , not understanding where she was , the mists of a dream of a happier time fading from her mind .
tr	5	He moved through the gate to the second tier of the city , passing cheering Kindred , hearing the sound of retreat blown on Imperial horns .
va	5	As she climbed , Claire marvelled at the buildings , where the road started at the lower floor window and passed somewhere near the upper floor .
tr	5	Dallas was built on the economy and if there is anything which is true it 's people of all races and genders like the color of money .
va	5	It had subsequently developed that there were in fact two armies heading north from Mexico , and Goliad was directly within the path of the second one .

tr	5	We have crossed through three universes and have arrived in an orbit around a planet that appears to have all the conditions necessary to sustain life forms .
tr	5	Gizmo asked Giselle to transmit the coordinates of his orbit and ask if it was likely he was being tracked or followed from the ground .
tr	5	Looking around , Gizmo was unsure where it had come from or if there were any more of its kind lurking around to ambush him .
tr	5	The vibration in the ground , and the thundering sound of their hoofs hammering the terrain would generally give anyone sufficient time to seek shelter .
tr	5	If they were lucky enough to have water flowing through , the water 's edge was built up to keep the water on its designated course .
tr	5	§ § § Marco 's people were more concerned about day to day survival than they were about whether they shared the universe with other intelligent life .
tr	5	Over the next couple of years Marco spent every free moment he had on redesigning an old radio he had managed to get his hands on .
tr	5	But he didn 't know anyone else able to duplicate the communication device he built so he was fairly sure this had to be the real thing .
tr	5	With his heart beating so hard he almost couldn 't move , he mustered all the courage and strength he had in him and stood up .
tr	5	Marco was shaken when the alien stepped out of his vehicle wearing something on his head with a picture of one of his prime food sources .
tr	5	What would this stranger think when he found out that creature depicted on the strangers head gear would most likely consist of Marco 's evening meal ?
tr	5	§ § § This being an historic event , and not knowing what to say , Gizmo thought humor would be the best course of action .
tr	5	One evening in an intergalactic bar they met an interesting pair of individuals claiming to be from a distant star they would undoubtedly find interesting .
tr	5	Gizmo would have been interested even if he hadn 't been drinking a brew of unknown origin , but as they talked , Gizmo found himself hooked .
tr	5	§ § § The Universal Star Colony , on the planet Colossus , was set up in the furthermost corner of the furthermost known universe .
tr	5	Since its atmosphere was not particularly hospitable to most life forms , it was not a destination , or generally on the way to any known destination .
tr	5	Only the tip was on the planet surface , and that was enclosed in an invisible force field that held atmosphere in and most other things out .
tr	5	The Colony was pretty much a closed community , and only accepted new members rarely , and then only by a unanimous vote of the council .
tr	5	But the fact remains , it 's better to have them on our side than have them jumping from universe to universe doing whatever pleases them .
tr	5	It would take centuries for his species to rise to even a minimal amount of awareness of intergalactic affairs , if in fact they ever do .
tr	5	It could be good news or bad , Gizmo wasn 't sure how to read the lengthening silence in the room while all eyes were on them .
tr	5	As Sula finished , with a sweep of his hands , the doors they had come through once again opened and their escorts were waiting for them .
tr	5	It was also the first stop because they both would undergo a complete medical examination and they would need to remain here for the first few days .

tr	5	There was silence in the room as he arranged his papers , continuing to eye them suspiciously , and then he approached them with two small objects .

tr	5	Feeling satisfied that he lost his tail , Simon decided to take the next left , which would allow him to eventually re-enter the freeway further south .

te	5	Her early confidence evaporated and she could feel the hot flush rising up her neck as it did when she felt out of her depth .
tr	5	A second later , a spray of water blew into the air as the ocean waves were slapped by the black fin of an orca whale .
tr	5	Instead , it was just a man wearing a gray , lacquered wooden mask , with a long black beard and curved ram horns attached .
tr	5	Suddenly it all seemed too much -- the train ride , Mana 's disappearance , the cut hair , the disgusting cell she was in .
tr	5	Once there , he picked up several pieces of luggage and took them back upstairs to find the boys and Beth at the window again .
tr	5	She moved and released a soft moan but with one swift expert strike , he knocked her unconscious and then flung her over his shoulders .
te	5	After I left , Mr. No Name jumped in his helicopter and took off back to his cave or wherever the hell he came from .
te	5	His manner of speech is addictive , and I feel as if I am in a trance , hanging on every word he 's saying .
te	5	The way he said it elicited a fleeting mental image , and I began to feel like a caricature of the energizer bunny or a Timex watch .
tr	5	There had been very few boys in her village who weren 't her cousins , and she hadn 't spent much time really thinking about them .
tr	5	Maybe there was a scent to his own kind , male and female , that his body recognized even when his mind didn 't acknowledge it .
tr	5	An hour or so later , the Captain signaled the other ships to set anchor and the crew gathered on deck to prepare for the raid .
tr	5	The knives sank into the dark waves and for a moment Sarah could have sworn she saw a pair of aquamarine eyes staring back at her .
tr	5	His energy on those premises so powerfully matched the energy of the big rats that they felt at home freely damaging all the birds ' clothes .
tr	5	When he returned with the drink she downed it quickly and got the courage to specifically ask about the men sitting in the corner of the room .
tr	5	" Obviously I can 't be certain without having the results of a full blown autopsy but frankly I 've seen this before but not in foals .
tr	5	Subject to the autopsy which we 've put a rush on by the way , I would say the foal did not die of natural causes .
tr	5	Callahan , travelling as Lou Phillips , boarded the Leeds train at Kings Cross and settled in for the two and a half hour trip .
tr	5	It was a normal morning with the exception that she missed George and their traditional morning conversation over breakfast , except it wasn 't normal at all .
tr	5	Too many coincidences ; she remembered Robbie telling her that coincidences get you killed , expect the worst and anything else comes as a pleasant surprise .
tr	5	He remembered the Toyota Land Cruiser leaving the house and heading north but he had no idea who was driving or how many were in it .
tr	5	Viv was wearing clothes that Jen had picked out of her closet even though they were a little large for her on her scrawny frame .
tr	5	It housed George 's extensive collection of native artifacts and weapons acquired over the years he had spent on active service all over the world .

va	5	They were both lost in the moment and for a short time the young couple felt peace and joy and complete release from all of their anxieties .
tr	5	What this leads to is a temptation for the lazy and uninformed to use those wonders of water management as their own personal dumping ground .

tr	5	Elaina flushed at the attention , especially with half her legs showing -- exposed to the knee with the white lace hem of her camisole peeking out .
tr	5	There was a slightly rumpled dress and a pristine white camisole folded loosely and thrown across her knees , and Cade was rummaging about in the saddlebags .
tr	5	He must have thrown them on her -- that was why she was suddenly so very wide awake , not at all like her usual .
tr	5	Cade sold the third horse to pay for the room and then some , so it was just the two of them and their mounts .
tr	5	Elaina knew it was still too slow for Cade by the way he kept staring up at the sky marking the position of the sun .
tr	5	It was far too hot , and she looked like a fool , but she was well past caring that Cade watched with a hint of surprise .
tr	5	Cade insisted on scouting up and down the road for the place the trees grew up closest , wanting to stay as hidden as possible .
tr	5	Women were a maze in the dark in the best of times , he knew , and he hardly had the experience to manage this one .
tr	5	Perhaps that was the source of her fury : she had not forgiven him for holding her captive , but was too scared to part ways .
tr	5	Cade didn 't delude himself , she was not frightened of the world at large and seeking protection -- though he thought she should have been .
tr	5	The newness of his freedom and the necessities of survival were distracting him from it , but Cade felt the raw emptiness of missing his brother constantly .
tr	5	CHAPTER 23 The Strangers They entered the small space without a care for Cade 's weapon , which was either very brave or very foolish .

tr	5	Cade held back a snort -- if he was able to hear from across the clearing , Darin 's ears were not the motive for his move .

tr	5	Well , not quite almost -- she remembered the awkwardness of waking up with someone who held her like it was some kind of duty .

te	5	I tried to ignore it , just going over to the cafeteria and getting a tray , but I felt like everyone was watching me .
tr	5	From the plans of the estate that Victor had procured , we knew it would lead us to one of four cellars underneath the mansion .
te	5	The spot where the Exiles had chosen to make camp that night was in the shelter of a narrow passage through a large stone wall .
tr	5	' Besides , ' I added drily after a pause , ' someone like you is bound to kill himself after a day without a smoke . '
tr	5	Walking up Sea Street , he wandered through the growing throngs of people on the sidewalk getting a head start on the Memorial Day holiday .
tr	5	The man stared at Francisco , an indescribable expression on his face - was it fear , or was it hatred -- turned , and ran .
tr	5	 Well , that 's right up my alley then , I 'm the queen of all things silly ,  Lilly Ann announced dramatically .
va	5	My mother picked me up and held me , trying to find some way to soothe my pain , but nothing was making the burning stop .
te	5	He jammed on his shoes and trotted quickly through the battleship , edging sideways through hatches as other men went in opposite directions past him .
tr	5	 Our battalion reserve company is really nothing more than a slightly augmented platoon ,  he began , indicating his men with a wave .
tr	5	More importantly , the general expert opinion was that it would take at least two years to fully integrate the data and ensure back-up capability .
tr	5	Her shoulder throbbed but it could not smother her heart rate every time she looked at him or listened to his strong , calming voice .
tr	5	"It was the Friday night before Halloween that Sunday that the boys had a sleep over and invited "" one friend each "" as directed by Mom ."
tr	5	I hurried back so I could get Jim and Herb working on the details , it would keep them busy for the next couple of days .
tr	5	I reached for the branch , and it only took me a second to realize ... that I was only a tad too far to reach it .
tr	5	Before the man could attack , Jeff grabbed his arm and brought it swiftly down onto his knee , knocking the knife from the man 's hand .
va	5	Without needing his analytical circuits to predict the matter , Zero was already intimately aware the Greyhounds would be better prepared for him this time .
tr	5	Jeff moved his grip on the mop handle so that he could attempt to block and parry with both the middle and ends of the staff .
te	5	They talked about Davin 's plans for the day and he asked her why she had been absent from the breakfast table for the past few days .
tr	5	I recognised the look on his face , it was the same one I 'd seen when he was escorting me to the lab ; bewilderment .
tr	5	One of the boys ran on ahead to keep tabs on the sisters while the other followed them so close that he was practically under their feet .
tr	5	Also by Amanda Martin : BABY BLUES AND WEDDING SHOES Amanda 's latest release , the chick lit novel Baby Blues and Wedding Shoes is available now .
tr	5	I thought about my mom 's disguise at the Eiffel , her directions to burn the package , and her fear when she 'd shushed me .
tr	5	 Oh , doing it doing it ,  Arjun said , his tone expressive of him now gathering an understanding of Ankit 's words .
va	5	With Mai 's assistance he 's learned shielding himself is essentially pointless , her advanced warnings centering his posture on evasion as opposed to defense or deflection .
tr	5	I only ask that you allow those citizens living there the right to sell their homes and move south or grant them full JP citizenship rights .
te	5	It was one thing to test yourself in a sporting contest ; he could even grasp the validity of fighting to defend yourself or another .
tr	5	His fingertips dug into his flesh and he slammed the back of his head against the wall over and over again until he lost consciousness .
tr	5	Few steps and she will be roasted on the burning flame beneath just like the dirt that had fell from the ground where she was standing .
tr	5	That had to hurt , but it also made Kim worldly wise and self-reliant well before the time when it was no longer a choice .
tr	5	Pushing herself off the wall , trying to ignore the numbness in her bottom from sitting on the cold stone , Claire smiled gratefully at the woman .
tr	5	The worst day of his life seems as though it will never end , the screams and blasts of light above paralyzing him with fear .
va	5	From the sound of the many footsteps following her they 'd gotten their act together enough to give up fighting each other and just go for her .
va	5	The distressed looking lady went on to make a call to the cell phone of her older son , who as a coincidence was also missing .
tr	5	And we all had room service together at a beautifully draped table replete with hotel silver and the appropriate covers to keep the dishes deliciously hot .

tr	5	The ostrich egg wasn 't big , not in comparison to their egg ; which begged the question , What kind of egg am I carrying ?

tr	5	Matthew returned the favor in kind , and before long , it seemed that there was more water on the floor than in the tubs .
tr	5	It terrified more than any blow , and she was unable to stop her body from flinching as his fingers made contact with her flesh .
tr	5	He drew from the clouds rolling outside and made it rain , catching the water before it landed on the Council but letting it fall on himself .
tr	5	His face gave away a lot more of his frustration than his voice , though he was still doing better than she was at faking civility .
tr	5	They were tall seats like you would find in a bar and most seats were vacant so I chose one , particularly because of its neighbour .
tr	5	Without an instant to breath between the seamless attacks , Mai appears once again , mimicking Rift 's style , but with her own girlish flair .
tr	5	"I 'm going to turn on the yard lights , "" she told her brother and went through a nearby door and into the kitchen ."
tr	5	As she hung up the phone Claire felt for the first time in her life that a guardian angel might be looking out for her .
tr	5	But Ethan would do what was required to keep her near in the hope that he could convince her that he was someone she could trust .
tr	5	"Ethan and the others had lunched at the same place of her last meal , and Ethan moved in front of her and started to spill . """

tr	5	" And a lot of repeated personal invitations by phone and e-mail , and networks of phone helpers , and voila , they have come .
va	5	They did ask right off about the Man Wolf attack at the house , with the same old questions and Reuben gave them the same old answers .
va	5	The place appeared picturesque enough , as always , yet he couldn 't prevent a frisson from paralyzing him as he looked at the graves .
va	5	But she 'd like to add a short paragraph to today 's story , about the Man Wolf being nowhere in sight during the village fair .
va	5	One potter confessed she wished she brought all of her new mugs and bowls , as she was now left with almost nothing to sell .
va	5	It was so easy to see them as they passed , as they walked among the human beings , so easy to know who they were .
va	5	Within moments a new air of festivity had swept through the fair , and it seemed the noise of the crowd was louder than ever .
va	5	Felix waved at Reuben from down the street , but then was blocked inevitably by more greetings and more thanks , though he kept moving .
va	5	This place is done up so beautifully and this is all going to be so much fun , you don 't have to do any heavy lifting .
va	5	To Reuben 's surprise , Thibault appeared and explained that he was taking Reuben out to stand with Felix at the large east entrance of the pavilion .
va	5	The voices of the adult choir soon joined in , and the entire glorious wave of sound proceeded without the need of the waiting orchestra .
va	5	At the far end very near the choir , Reuben could see Phil alone at a table clearly rapt as he 'd been when Reuben first arrived .
va	5	Felix stood at the large eastern entrance of the pavilion greeting each and every person coming in , and Reuben quickly took his place beside him .
va	5	And there were plenty of women in hats , fantasy hats and vintage hats , and those little cocktail hats with veils that Jim had described .
va	5	Immediately , Rosie , the family housekeeper arrived , looking very pretty and girlish in a bright red dress with her full dark hair combed free .
va	5	She was his uncle Tim 's oldest daughter , and a redhead like Tim and Grace , and used to babysit Reuben when he was a kid .
va	5	Grandfather Spangler had been furious about it at the time , and Grace 's brother , Tim , a recent widower , had been brokenhearted .
va	5	Several old friends from Berkeley had found him and were full of questions about this house and what in the world had happened to him .
va	5	At one point , he heard Frank at his side , and Frank whispered ,  Don 't forget to look around , Wonder Pup ."
tr	5	Going through the tear gas wouldn 't be pleasant , but he knew it wouldn 't kill him , and he had endured much worse .

tr	5	We were surrounded by close half-timbered houses that seemed to slant inward dangerously , as if they 'd tumble down on us in an instant .
tr	5	And then I spotted it -- a silver bracelet with a strawberry red ruby in the middle , just like the one from my dream .
tr	5	 I can 't tell ; there 's too much blood to see the actual cut , but that can 't be a good sign . 
tr	5	"That I want to have you the only way I can , because you shut me out , you left me , you ... "" He stopped ."

tr	5	Even if no one had sighted those flying beasties , I would have expected the glow from the fires to have been noticed for miles around .

tr	5	He tilted his head , the masculine stubble of his chin a shocking contrast to the softness of his lips moving over my neck as he spoke .
tr	5	The Prince took off running on the top of the buildings , jumping from roof to roof , as fast as his feet could carry him .
tr	5	"Rowan talked : "" I tell myself we all run the risk of horror ; any child can be a monster , a bringer of death ."
tr	5	This caused the eyes to fog up quickly and made it hard to see -- I hated that Atticus was partially right -- this time .
va	5	He drove Laura south to get her Jeep and the bulk of her possessions , which amounted to so few boxes that he was kind of amazed .
tr	5	I looked around from the bridge to see if I could spot anything out of the ordinary hanging , or glowing from within the ground .

tr	5	The thought raised a flicker of happiness deep inside , but it was soon extinguished by her concern for Kim and her need to get home .
tr	5	In a while , she pointed ahead to a decrepit , dock , and I slowly motored over and tied off to one of the pilings .
tr	5	I had a long sprint ahead of me , in bare feet in the dark , and I was definitely not looking forward to it .

tr	5	Then far away he heard the sea banging on the coast , banging , the waves sounding like big guns as they thundered on the beach .
tr	5	We saw the same sacks of spuds , the same pile of coal , the same rusty old tools and the same cobwebs hanging from the ceiling .

tr	5	By the end of the day , before I opened the refrigerator for the third beer I was pretty convinced that I had packed all I wanted .
tr	5	One by one , she pulled out the chocolates and the fluffy doll from my pockets and like on any other day , was looking for more .

tr	5	Remembering that he had left his luggage at Jon 's , he decided to get over there and pick it up while he had time .

tr	5	* * * The taxi pulled away onto North London 's Chingford Mount Road , leaving Amy searching beneath the knickers in her handbag for keys .
tr	5	Bidding Danny goodnight she zigzagged across the threadbare living room carpet and passed the kitchen piled high with dirty pots and plates to the bathroom .
tr	5	Apart from the waiter who seemed displeased to have someone of lesser means in his bar , Calvin suspected everyone to be as happy as they seemed .
tr	5	Alert to danger each footstep seemed to push the lighthouse further away until , at last within twenty feet of the harbour mouth , he stopped .
tr	5	Biting plastic wrapped passport and money he eased into the water ; the contrasting temperature took his breath away as Katherine indicated him towards the stern .
tr	5	To her he seemed different from the jealous boys she 'd grown up with and the controlling guys in Saint Tropez from whom she remained detached .
tr	5	Katherine watched him look it over as she would a computer 's innards -- or like someone who 'd lied about being able to play guitar .
tr	5	Interrupting his thinking Katherine said , ' I mean there 're plenty of beds here and ... well ... you haven 't sung yet . ' '
tr	5	' Look , if you don 't want to sing -- ' Too late Calvin began strumming chords before nervousness got the better of him .
tr	5	They had ten days of holiday left and I spent every night with them sailing port to port and meeting loads of other people . '
tr	5	In finding the hired bicycle untouched he realised how absurd he 'd been imagining he could offer enough to sway someone like Katherine from such a place .
tr	5	As the road stretched leading to certain confrontation with the bicycle hire man Calvin wondered whether he would recover from the pain of never seeing her again .
tr	5	' Yes , he could join other bands but if they don 't suffer his crap then he 'll have to join another band , and another .
tr	5	Saturday 18th June 1983 The following Saturday the lads shopped in London 's Denmark Street for an amp to replace Danny 's ailing practice amp .
tr	5	When Danny shook his head Amy thought , Well stuff you , and left him with Calvin before heading to where she 'd seen the drummer earlier .
tr	5	He could have any girl he wanted , Amy thought as her drunken logic overruled the low opinion she had of herself during sober hours .
tr	5	' Okay he 's in a band , so he 's no reason to be interested but it 's still a blow to the ego . '
tr	5	Ignoring Danny 's crudeness Calvin said , ' Of course , he 's not rejected us musically , because he hasn 't actually heard our songs . '
tr	5	Amy speaks well of you but , being honest , last night you didn 't strike me as guys I 'd want to start a band with .
tr	5	' Okay , we know we didn 't impact last night , ' Calvin said undeterred , ' but how could we get your interest ? '
tr	5	But Raphael 's caresses came as slowly as the tide ; his kisses washing over her body relaxing her and transporting her far from the city .
tr	5	' Hi , ' he said slowing down as he passed the phone at the top of the stairs pretending he hadn 't been rushing .
tr	5	But because 10,000 Faces is still embryonic if we 're to do stuff together he wants an equal part -- like a founder member . '
tr	5	When they arrived back in the room Danny said into his mic , ' Okay , things might have seemed too good to be true before . '
tr	5	After making the brews Danny fought to hide his disappointment in the dumped 1960 's style relic which looked more beaten up than his decommissioned practice amp .
tr	5	Tired and still a teensy bit drunk she swayed as if on a ship 's deck waiting to cross the road to the exam hall .
tr	5	Let 's crank it up and see if we can get this thing singing , just the way you want before you start looking at pedals . '
tr	5	' Ze time to be happy is now ; especially as we can 't know for certain rock stardom 's ze key to happiness . '
tr	5	Getting down to a home rehearsal they chose five songs to master guessing their first gigs would be twenty minute spots supporting more experienced amateur bands .
tr	5	' Well , ' Calvin said sounding reluctant , ' it didn 't seem worth mentioning given her stubborn refusal to take any contact details .
tr	5	I 'm on four weeks trial starting Monday and , given the busiest time is the start of the week , I should be off Fridays . '
tr	5	' And there was me thinking we 'd use the early Dog and Parrot gig to be good enough for The Water Rats , ' Danny said .
tr	5	Looking from the living room to what had recently been Calvin 's tidy kitchen he asked , ' Is ze kitchen tidy or messy ? '
tr	5	' So , ' Raphael said drying the pot Calvin passed him , ' if it 's true we can think our way to rock stardom . '
tr	5	Please for me and Danny forget your dad 's advice and Coventry ; give us a hundred percent at least until ze twelve months are up .
tr	5	She 'd seen him looking nervous before gigs in the past but seeing his skin appear ashen , feared he 'd be too scared to play .
tr	5	Looking but finding no cracks of insincerity Danny thanked him saying , ' You did a fine job ; the sound was crystal on stage . '
tr	5	Danny looked around the now three-quarter full room but the guy said , ' Door count says only ten of this lot are yours . '
tr	5	' Wow , ' he said startled seeing her at the top of the stairs , ' you nearly gave me a heart attack . '
tr	5	* * * Later that night finding herself alone with Danny , Amy said , ' You 've not had a girlfriend for a while . '
tr	5	' I haven 't brought anyone back here or gone back to anyone 's house since -- ' ' I know , I 'm sorry . '
tr	5	She went to him for a hug and left him with his guitar and pad of paper where he 'd written , The Only Time is Now .
tr	5	Almost breathless at the top of the stairs he saw Danny signal the barman who 'd turn the jukebox off after whatever current track finished .
tr	5	Picking a spot on the stage he watched it diminish with lift-off and enlarge again as his feet touched down with cymbals crashing his eardrums .
tr	5	* * * Back in the flat seeing Calvin put the kettle on Raphael said , ' So it 's just me going out ? '
tr	5	In fact , ' he said reaching to his pocket , ' take a card it 's got my number on it just in case . '
tr	5	The final , rather arrogant band , hadn 't wanted to share their equipment meaning Little Spirit would have to use all their own gear .
tr	5	Raphael said , ' It 's just like I read in Ze Crowd ' ' They really do think as one , ' Calvin agreed .
tr	5	His words stated he 'd love to see her at the gig but guessed they 'd have played before she even received the letter she now held .
tr	5	Danny set his guitar on its stand as Amy , sitting by his amp , watched students fail to access the hall for a glimpse of Bananarama .
tr	5	He didn 't see heads turn and follow the image of perfect female elegance walking chin held high with shining dark eyes anxiously fixed on him .
tr	5	* * * An hour earlier Katherine , fearing she 'd got the wrong polytechnic , saw Bananarama posters that didn 't mention Calvin 's band .
tr	5	Calvin nodded his thanks then , before Danny 's riff wearied , he signalled to the band as the bass thundered them into a tremendous intro chorus .
tr	5	That night back at the flat Amy went to the kitchen and shouted to Calvin and Katherine , ' Do you two fancy a cuppa ? '
tr	5	* * * Before getting up Katherine relaxed in Calvin 's arms relieved that the gamble she 'd taken in turning up had paid off .
tr	5	Though Katherine didn 't know how long she would or could stay with Calvin she swore to stick by her rule both financially and socially .
tr	5	A girl from the student union staff said once you guys hit the stage the rush to get in caused a queue round the building .
tr	5	* * * Later that afternoon when the lads returned from rehearsal Amy said , ' Me and Katherine have been discussing it -- image that is .
tr	5	After a couple of hours traipsing around Chingford 's businesses Katherine headed to The Lion , where she 'd arranged to meet Calvin for lunch .
tr	5	' Nah , Amy seems to like you and if you turn out to be dodgy it 'll be no more gigs for Little Spirit . '
tr	5	Katherine wouldn 't have let them buy anything even if they 'd wanted arguing the clothes would look cheap and unflattering if they didn 't fit properly .
tr	5	Back at the flat she left the boys in the living room drawing huge letters on the fabric as it became the band 's backdrop .
tr	5	If people know that I 've financed a credible band then I might look cool or generous either of which could lead to better deals . '
tr	5	Raphael looks better , his drumming 's infinitely better ; as is his sound and he got me a deal on my guitar pedals . '
tr	5	Monday 26th September 1983 Amy called into Katherine 's pub on her way to poly with the results of her and Danny 's phone calls .
tr	5	In Calvin 's room they leafed through the pages but to Amy , personal beauty seemed too distant a goal as one gorgeous image flicked to another .
tr	5	' Well , mum answered but cried so much that before I knew it I said I 'd go and see her this Friday . '
tr	5	' I 've not told anyone but before you arrived I was starving myself of sex -- like Danny would stupidly think I was a virgin . '
tr	5	Everyone decided to go to the pub so in her room Amy tried some outfits sure she 'd look good if she held a decent posture .
tr	5	Friday 30th September 1983 On the same Friday morning as the girls left for Cumbria , the lads arrived at the studio before the owner .
tr	5	The distant cliffs reached the horizon , where a chemical factory with two metal chimneys tirelessly raced fat swirling worms of smoke into the sky .
tr	5	' We 'll catch another bus to Mum 's from the station , ' Katherine said as they descended the final road into the town 's centre .
tr	5	Like many of the passengers the driver looked rock hard , like he 'd just as sooner kick your head in than sell you a ticket .
tr	5	That said Tom changed his tune once Raphael came to record his parts saying he 'd never worked with a drummer as accurate or expressive .
tr	5	Barbara hoisted Katherine 's bag as Amy ran with mother and daughter along the street of dead gardens , boarded windows and clapped out cars .
tr	5	She didn 't breathe under the gaze sinking to her chin , neck and chest freezing her as Alan 's contempt reordered forming contemptuous lust .
tr	5	Left fending for herself she accepted the fear but found it passing as it became apparent that the smoke had no grounds to hurt her .
tr	5	' Not able to please both families I caved to Alan 's request and without the blessing of my parents married on my eighteenth birthday .
tr	5	Sunday 02nd October 1983 Next morning in the kitchen Katherine asked her mum , ' Where 's Dad , didn 't he come home ? '
tr	5	' You 've never allowed me a job , ' she said with comparative calm especially considering how emotional she 'd been upon Katherine 's return .
tr	5	But worse than that , though she 'd missed him , she found herself not wanting anything to do with him -- friends or otherwise .
tr	5	She went into the landing hating herself knowing Danny couldn 't be blamed for the past grief he 'd caused her but what could she do ?
tr	5	' She 'll be applying for Olympic grants soon , ' Katherine said and seeing his work asked , ' Are these inlay card designs ? '
tr	5	* * * At Hemel in his post studio excitement Raphael had bought a headset microphone so he could drum and sing without craning his neck .
tr	5	After some minutes of conversation Raphael asked , ' Is everything okay , I 'm guessing you weren 't just ringing for a chat ? '
tr	5	' I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night , not realising either you or Amy were in , blamed the stink on Calvin .
tr	5	Now Danny wondered whether he could fancy her as indeed he had when they 'd first met before their friendship developed and other girls absorbed his attention .
tr	5	Soon the boys headed out for soundcheck leaving Katherine to wait for Amy who arrived from her mum 's looking the best she 'd ever seen .
tr	5	Resting his hands on silenced guitar Danny sang to the bass line feeling the stage tremble under the galvanized rhythm of drums and Calvin 's stamping foot .
tr	5	' If you 'd allow Proper Printing 's details to be added to your posters and flyers we 'd happily waive the cost of them .
tr	5	We 've got a list of all the national record companies so when we meet John we can show him how ready to go we are . '
tr	5	Rather than head for the door John walked to the bar where he took Liz 's hand and thanked her before turning leaving her blushing .
tr	5	' Hopefully it 'll be fine , ' she said looking proudly at the new Little Spirit banner leaping from the front of the drums .
tr	5	* * * When everyone hit the venue 's bar John collared Katherine and said , ' The weather 's still warm in Saint Tropez . '
tr	5	Looking thoughtful she said , ' I 'm thinking my romantic feelings towards him were based on there being no danger of anything actually happening . '
tr	5	' I know but I 've had an idea and need you onside before approaching Danny -- especially with him being ze ideas man . '
tr	5	' First step to convincing Danny , ' Raphael said taking the groceries from the bag he 'd brought , ' is to feed him .
tr	5	I was thinking we should play streets like Brook Green where the EMI and Virgin offices are -- you know , put it under their noses . '
tr	5	Danny not wanting to face passers-by watched the drummer 's posture and fearlessness to look out into the park at anyone who cared to look at him .
tr	5	There they handed out flyers and promoted that night 's Water Rats gig before packing up and heading off to meet the girls ' plane .
tr	5	On the tube heading to the airport , Danny closed his eyes and thought of Amy and the blonde who 'd given him her number .
tr	5	' Wasn 't it JFK who said , We do these things , not because they 're easy but , because they 're hard ? '
tr	5	Saturday 05th November 1983 In the parks the next morning Danny felt more positive than the previous day as performances seemed to reach people more effectively .
tr	5	' Like I say , without distribution it wouldn 't appear in the shops and without PR or Marketing the masses won 't know about it . '
tr	5	When a label tells you that , it usually means they 're not looking to sign new acts ; not that many admit it . '
tr	5	Amy reckoned the only remaining date on the flyer would yield another no show as the poly 's main hall lay miles from GMD 's Camden office .
tr	5	Now , what I have here , ' Richard said pushing a stack of paper towards Raphael , ' is a one album recording contract . '
tr	5	As long as you understand and accept the terms of both those contracts and you appreciate The Production Annex sound that 's where you 're going . '
tr	5	He 'll tell him what 's what and if the documents are fair I 'll make sure he 's present when the lads sign . '
tr	5	They 'd spent hours filling in the lost years before Barbara admitted how wrong she 'd been and how right they 'd been about Alan .
tr	5	When it didn 't work he took Raphael 's , leave ' em wanting more , advice by actively ending the conversation saying he 'd ring Raphael .
tr	5	As requested he pulled the car into a courtyard where a Range Rover , a tractor and a fine old Jaguar stood by stable doors .
tr	5	' Well , ' Calvin started nearly choking on a raisin and looking between Katherine and Barbara , ' we haven 't actually discussed that . '
tr	5	Edward said he 'd drive her , Katherine and Calvin in the Jag until , as Barbara considered more stuff , Edward suggested the Range Rover .
tr	5	Calvin remained watching as Alan 's brain , like a computer performing damage reports , ran check after check each one coming back , ' okay ' .
tr	5	Austin 's studio had become available but , they 'd have to wait until February the following year if they didn 't start recording in two days .
tr	5	Monday 05th December 1983 The band had been told to get up when they wanted the next day but excitement had the better of them .
tr	5	Instead of Tom 's contemporary black and grey decor Austin 's control room had shabby brown walls and carpet , not soundproofed doors but hefty traditional oak .
tr	5	With Raphael banging drums in the live room Calvin and Danny joined Austin in the control room where the music they played came through immense studio monitors .
tr	5	Austin balancing sounds ran from room to room fine tuning the drum heads and swapping Raphael 's felt kick drum beater for a wooden one .
tr	5	The band finally understood that visual aesthetics paled in the face of sound quality 's importance as Austin drew fabulousness from the Soviet looking equipment .
tr	5	Big Country and Simple Minds gave them a run for their money but not so much as bands produced by Trevor Horn who 'd even outdone himself .
tr	5	Calvin drove and as they drew near they could see students packing out the Hyde Park Pub and celebrating around the paved outer area and picnic tables .
tr	5	' Hi John , ' Danny said before anyone else could and , after everyone else did , the waiter showed them to their table .
tr	5	She breakfasted with Katherine and Calvin while John and Barbara went to the single room to get changed and check out before going to The Production Annex .
tr	5	Amy took photos and John tried getting into them all until around 11am her camera ran out of film and John ran out of questions .
tr	5	Back in the control room Katherine watched her friend at the mic , with Austin and the band not buying her fake giggles and shrieks .
tr	5	Raphael stood up as if that 'd be the hardest thing he 'd have to do that day and led the way to the live room .
tr	5	Monday 19th December 1983 The next day Austin jumped in the van and directed the lads to the Hall Manor rehearsal rooms a short drive away .
tr	5	Calvin and Danny carted all the gear into the hall and onto its stage fabulously decked with lighting system and PA. ' Let 's get started ? '
tr	5	Austin loved Raphael 's new introductory music and remixed it adding the chants and cheers recorded when the girls and John had visited the studio .
tr	5	' Great , thanks , ' the drummer said with an air of arrogance that suggested Raphael wouldn 't understand the degree of their brilliance .
tr	5	That 's what I like to see and hear on my stage and that 's what I liked seeing you guys busking outside The Hyde Park pub .
tr	5	Thursday 22nd December 1983 On their final Thursday Calvin stood on Hall Manor 's stage singing his parts , his fingers happily finding their frets .
tr	5	On stage and into the set their certainty of the songs ' strength warmed the audience who couldn 't help but fall into sympathy with their vibe .
tr	5	' Anyway , Raphael you 're lucky to be walking out that club taking the mick out of that other band and nicking their girlfriends . '
tr	5	Though she knew he suffered from stage fright he always got through it but seeing him in the company of his dad had been a revelation .
tr	5	But just like most his eyes nearly popped out when he first saw her as the drowsiness that 'd followed the deacon 's sermon took flight .
tr	5	' I wonder how many lives we 'll change -- how many people will come to know and be entertained by what we do ? '
tr	5	By the end of the fifth song , I Can 't Wish , Richard pressed stop saying , ' I think we get the idea . '
tr	5	' So if they put masses into a band by way of a six-figure advance they 're going to work damn hard to get it back .
tr	5	You see when a band signs for marketing and distribution there 's nothing in the contract stipulating how hard the company has to work promoting your records .
tr	5	Every major 's investment is a gamble ; the majors are terrified just like I was when I sent you to Leeds with Austin 's cheque . '
tr	5	Danny said , ' What if we find some money and , once a single 's released , get everyone to buy bulk loads of it ? '
tr	5	If records start flying out of targeted shops Gallop will look closely at how it 's being promoted and how many are being returned . '
tr	5	By the end of January Little Spirit still hadn 't chance to employ Richard 's advice as they 'd not seen inside any major record company offices .
tr	5	Worryingly the general ripples of interest throughout the business flattened with the notion that Little Spirit 's solid rock sound offered nothing new for record buyers .
tr	5	If I was a girl Grace 's age and interested in you I wouldn 't want to read that you 're happy in a relationship .
tr	5	Though his amp hadn 't blacked in several gigs Calvin couldn 't miss the sudden drop in volume or the stench of electrical smoke that followed .
tr	5	The band carried on regardless and soon Amy and Grace had lost themselves in the sound of the band and the support act 's borrowed amp .
tr	5	Calvin looked up into the younger man 's eyes and felt like a boy being told by a caring parent that the bullies would be dealt with .
tr	5	When Katherine brought in a mug of tea she asked , ' So , how did you get on this afternoon , any inspired thoughts ? '
tr	5	' Of course , ' Raphael said setting the mug on the floor so he could pull a piece of paper from his coat pocket .
tr	5	Tying the towel round his middle he passed through the kitchen and living room where he flung his arms round himself as cold air engulfed him .
tr	5	' Not this time , ' Danny said though he hadn 't so much invited Calvin as told him he intended to go running with Amy alone .
tr	5	Pulling her hat further down anger and embarrassment washed through her , recognising them as the two who 'd humiliated month 's earlier in the Hippodrome .
tr	5	Giving up forcing his face to relax Calvin said , ' I 'd better go , the girls won 't have such luck getting backstage . '
tr	5	He left and found Katherine and Amy by the bar starting their first glass of dry white and stopped ten feet short to admire them .
tr	5	Amy watched her pass heading straight for Richard who still looked awkward but delighted to see her despite the two men she 'd brought along .
tr	5	' The thing is I 'm confident that we 'll get a video as good as any imaginable for a number of reasons I 'll come to .
tr	5	' So for the stuff with us on stage , ' Calvin asked , ' wouldn 't it have helped to see us live ? '
tr	5	* * * Putting their faith in the makeup girls who plied on foundation and eye shadow the boys edged towards a post new romantic look .
tr	5	We 'll probably go through the song ten times to make sure we 've got what we need by which time the audience may get restless .
tr	5	When it came he pulled the strings as he would normally and , because he heard bass , he felt the same as had he played it .
tr	5	Before the lads came out of makeup the three models exited still wearing colourful wigs but tight dresses that scarcely covered their buttocks and high heeled stilettos .
tr	5	' Sure , ' she said surprising Raphael who thought she 'd be way too shy to agree especially with her uncle lurking out of shot .
tr	5	Happy with what he saw Des brought the models in and shooting resumed with the dancing crowd and band members strutting around his designated female target .
tr	5	Calvin with a firm command of rhythm and having performed the song on stage many times felt a little put out when the instructions seemed so basic .
tr	5	As the lads bore down on her , the first one she 'd danced with that night moved in front and threw out a halting hand .
tr	5	With the first lad now behind sandwiching her , Amy still hugging herself screeched , ' Leave me alone or I 'll call the police . '
tr	5	The lad squealed but , perhaps out of shock , fell silent when the man kicked the backs of his legs slamming his knees to the ground .
tr	5	An hour later Little Spirit played to a full house delighting Richard and Des and many who had attended the video shoot still sporting Little Spirit T-shirts .
tr	5	Raphael , closer to Grace than Calvin or Danny , hadn 't worked out the chemistry between them especially after he 'd reacted to her stage kiss .
tr	5	The jeans and sweatshirts had given no suggestion of the body that existed beneath and now Raphael 's heart raced seeing what he 'd been missing .
tr	5	Eventually he stepped to the mic and , as all sound dropped away but for keyboards Johnny barely whispered the verse of the first song .
tr	5	Songs passed and standing between Calvin and Grace , Katherine witnessed for the first time in ages a band in the same league as Little Spirit .
tr	5	She tried to make it look like fate by getting Johnny to say certain things from the stage ; like it was meant to be .
tr	5	If you ask a bricklayer if he 's good at building walls he 's bound to say yes ; if that 's all he does .
tr	5	We saw his band a few times and just had to have that guitar because I went all over London but couldn 't find one as good .
tr	5	Once it was disguised I did as I always did before I had pennies to rub together , I told people I 'd won it .
tr	5	' Yeah I suppose , ' Raphael said thanking God for Calvin 's generosity but wondering how he 'd cross London in the weekend 's early hours .
tr	5	Behind the screen again he changed into a fresh pair of jeans which he rolled to the knee and a black shirt which he left undone .
tr	5	' They sound like animals , ' she said taking his hand as if flirting would dilute her feelings of betrayal towards Danny having met Marlon .
tr	5	' They got more money , ' Des said when he found them , ' but we 'll see whose video comes out best . '
tr	5	She 'd not given him her phone number and until that evening , the first day of April , hadn 't been to his place .
tr	5	Compared to Danny 's hers seemed oppressive and given that the sun moved off her window after first light it always had a slight dampness to it .
tr	5	But Amy had already made her mind up and slipping her feet into her shoes she headed for the front door without saying bye or being seen .
tr	5	Through further questions Katherine learned that Barbara had bought a passport and from the description guessed that her mum had left the country with John .
tr	5	Dave Whitaker was gutted to have lost Nik Kershaw to MCA and Howard Jones to WEA just to give you an idea where he 's at . '
tr	5	But now Richard and I , without the aid of the William Morris Agency , have got you into a whole new batch of venues .
tr	5	' But , ' Danny said taking a moment , ' We 've been told there 's no point playing these sorts of games . '
tr	5	Trudie told them to meet her by the lifts and once out of earshot Raphael said , ' I know how you two feel . '
tr	5	We should be looking forward to this and the better gigs and if nothing else we 're making money busking which nobody can take from us . '
tr	5	Not normally given to praying he found himself asking someone somewhere for good fortune as the lift took off through the floors before halting abruptly .
tr	5	Of Raphael 's carpet comment Dave said , ' You guys are fantastic , no doubt about that but it 's still early days . '
tr	5	Danny , like everyone else stared expectantly at the black screen where Raphael 's boot suddenly appeared kicking the bass drum as the beat started .
tr	5	Sure enough , when the time to play arrived the club couldn 't manage any more punters , So much for Monday being quiet , Raphael thought .
tr	5	I don 't want to rock the boat with Trudie but I 've taken phone calls the past two days from interested parties at Polydor and Island .
tr	5	' They 're interested to know where you 're at and because you 've been doing so well I 've had quite a bit to tell them .
tr	5	She 'd probably have left Little Spirit for a week or two but had worked late on Monday and The Electric Ballroom lay on her path home .
tr	5	Wednesday 18th April 1984 Letters had flown between Katherine and Loretta but none ever confirmed whether Elaine 's wedding chapel and venue payments had been finalised .
tr	5	He pushed the shop 's door open just in time to hear the last few bars of Only When it 's Saturday before another track started .
tr	5	' Normally we move on the when a shop runs out of records but , because it 's you ... ' ' Aw , thank you gorgeous .
tr	5	' Anyway we need to get performing the fella in the shop says loads of copies came in yesterday and shoppers have already enquired about us today .
tr	5	' Okay , ' Katherine said hiding her surprise , ' if you end it you 've got to realise that he 'll eventually meet someone else .
tr	5	' Well I 've heard the single , which I love , I 've met you and found you all very decent and extremely well styled .
tr	5	It 'll be sailing into the North Sea ; a pirate radio station that 'll constantly stream UK hits including Only When it 's Saturday .
tr	5	When he went in you guys were on the video screens too so he reported back to base and someone checked up via me . '
tr	5	That bottle blonde just told you she loves the record ; we 'll see if that 's true when Smash Hits next comes out . '
tr	5	Before Katherine could think of a suitable answer Amy said , ' You 've just equalised ; you and Calvin both pulled a music journalist . '
tr	5	Initially she 'd refrained from giving him any of the flat 's details to protect Danny 's feelings but perhaps instinct had been warning her .
tr	5	She imagined Calvin had just presented her an Easter egg and wondered if she should have gone to her parents ' over the holiday period .
tr	5	Puzzled , Amy approached , tapped and put her head into the room where , on the desk , her books stood all orderly awaiting her attention .
tr	5	' I suppose we 've been very fortunate , ' Raphael said , ' but a little more good fortune wouldn 't go a miss . '
tr	5	Danny gave a wave and received a cheer back though felt somewhat fraudulent given that half of them had appeared at the sight of TV cameras .
tr	5	When Richard hung up Raphael banged on Calvin and Danny 's doors and shouted , ' We need to get to Manchester by 4pm . '
tr	5	' You 're right it 's easy to forget how long ze journey is amongst ze excitement of interviews and ze few sell-out gigs we 've done .
tr	5	' Let 's set up double quick like he said and if he doesn 't like it it 'll only be more work for him . '
tr	5	' The shop owner told our guy that this is the first copy he 's sold since the first batch of just three units came in .
tr	5	' I reckon our stage performance will speak for itself but if he doesn 't want to hear us perform acoustically his attitude could affect viewers . '
tr	5	On his side of the stage Danny inappropriately found the relief and irony of the song 's first line , Please help me , hilarious .
tr	5	' We get a lot of bands on , like yourselves , who 're looking for exposure and they might bring some skill but perhaps little else .
tr	5	That includes you and I know you 're mostly a very confident person and when you 're not you make up the deficit with bravado .
tr	5	' I don 't believe this we 're about to sign the most important contract of our lives and you don 't want to ? '
tr	5	* * * ' Morning , ' she said kicking Danny 's door closed behind her and setting the tray of tea and toast down .
tr	5	We all know this the flat isn 't big enough for the five of us so we need to think about alternatives starting now . '
tr	5	I don 't depress you with the bad news and I protect you from the so called good news ... ' he opened a desk draw .
tr	5	' Nevertheless , ' Richard said maintaining order , ' let 's save any excitement until the papers are signed and the money comes in . '
tr	5	So next we look at which company is offering us the best deal and , more importantly , which company has our best interests at heart . '
tr	5	After the chitchat ran thin Trudie said , ' I 'm really sorry but I 'll have to go and see what 's holding him up . '
tr	5	He got a phone call earlier from the proprietor of a London record shop who claims Gallup rang him this morning querying Little Spirit sales . '
tr	5	It seems a record shop in Manchester flagged them last night when he sold his first Little Spirit single to someone in the BBC . '
tr	5	The other lawyer , Peter , told Richard he 'd head back to his office but would return as soon as the problem had been remedied .
tr	5	Grace who remained serene asked Trudie , ' Not that it should but could a situation like this affect Dave 's decision to move forward ? '
tr	5	On this hand you have proven yourselves to be highly styled , highly entertaining on and off stage , highly industrious , and incredibly hard working .
tr	5	And most important of all to me highly synergistic ; thus creating results that have wowed me and , it would seem Gallup too . '
tr	5	Richard may have told you that in March , EMI lost a legal battle and was fined for over influencing record shops efforts to sell singles . '
tr	5	' This may be a factor in how you guys managed to attain such a high place without constant airplay and a Top of the Pops appearance .
tr	5	But Little Spirit would surely leap onto Rock ' n ' Roll 's gravy train beyond poverty 's precipice and that made her head spin .
tr	5	It became obvious that affordable properties in London got snapped up instantly ; they 'd have to be ready to move the moment something presented itself .
tr	5	' Firstly the advance has come and I 've opened a business account called Little Spirit which ; we 'll get all our names on .
tr	5	I should let you know we 're looking for another place to live and from what I can see there 'll be a rent hike . '
tr	5	He didn 't give a thought to the traffic passing behind until without a second 's warning an opened Coke can clattered into the pavement .
tr	5	' She 's getting ludicrously priced plates for this wedding , ' he said before running through the points Richard had made the previous day .
tr	5	Tuesday 8th May 1984 Amy waited for signs of life the following day and got up when she heard Calvin going to the living room .
tr	5	Following The Tube national interest in the band continued to flourish and , as the weather became hotter they pulled greater crowds in London 's parks .
tr	5	' Still , I 'd just love for us to get our own tour ; see our names at the top of the tickets . '
tr	5	' You 'll look terrific on this little stage , ' he said advising them of marked spots on the stage from which they 'd perform from .
tr	5	Unable to decipher yelled words she saw security guards forcibly removing two lads smartly dressed in crimson shirts ; one looked like Brian the other like Marlon .
tr	5	But , his self-assurance didn 't soar genuinely as he discovered every time he came under fire and saw his courage vanish like smoke in a hurricane .
tr	5	Marlon 's anger and assault of Amy had maddened Danny but that the aggressor might now be back for more saturated Danny 's being with indignation .
tr	5	When they headed into London Katherine explained that after the Astoria everyone including Richard had headed to Trudie 's apartment where they 'd all crashed .
tr	5	Calvin said , ' We 're looking to move and places don 't hang around plus Enfield isn 't too far from where we are now . '
tr	5	Having taken residence of the settee again , Raphael woke when Calvin and Danny joined him a moment before Amy arrived waving a pad of paper .
tr	5	John 's agreed a 6pm meeting at the properties so let 's hope it 's quiet enough in the pub for Katherine to get away early . '
tr	5	It seemed that although Leyton had been gutted when the previous deal fell through he had found serious interest in one of the houses at higher rent .
tr	5	Wednesday 23rd May 1984 The deal on the new houses came together so quickly there wouldn 't have been time to move without a dawn start .
tr	5	Not only had Katherine finished her time at the pub but Trudie had assigned her a band to style on her return from Saint Tropez .
tr	5	An hour after that and Katherine lost Amy and herself in the hugging arms of more Saint Tropez friends than she 'd ever seen around the marina .
tr	5	The girls found a table when John arrived and though the conversation lightened Katherine noticed Amy massaged her temples but hardly spoke and John appeared serious .
tr	5	' I tried to be as honest as I could but truthfully I couldn 't say your mother and I were no more than friends .
tr	5	Katherine launched into what had happened punctuating everything with , ' I 'm so annoyed , ' and , ' what really makes me angry . '
tr	5	The photographs took an age so as soon as Katherine , Amy and Barbara had been snapped a couple of times they headed back towards the marina .
tr	5	' They have , they demo 'd it in London and John gave it to Gareth , not that he mentioned it was Little Spirit . '
tr	5	* * * ' There you are , ' Calvin said finding their girls on deck together after they 'd finally managed to leave the stage .
tr	5	' I 'm sorry we couldn 't tell you about the gig , ' Calvin said when his bandmates and Amy left for the bar .
tr	5	' What a fabulous room , ' Calvin said getting comfy ' Hmm , ' said Katherine as the previous night 's feelings spiralled back .
tr	5	' Nonsense , ' Katherine said , ' you 're very welcome ; I mean , apart from this being your yacht of course . '
tr	5	He glared at the back of Stu 's head with a frustration he 'd not felt for his best friend since their vehement introduction years earlier .
tr	5	Competent in only the most trivial of matters , Dane had been an office jockey dumped on them against his will by their record company .
tr	5	Stu loved America and had been grateful when none of the band objected to starting the second US tour right off the back of their first .
tr	5	Stu believed only he understood Johnny 's stoicism but as songs passed he tried but couldn 't guess what had spooked his pal so badly .
tr	5	' And Trudie 's too wrapped up with Little Spirit , as GMD are right now , ' Johnny said as if reading her mind .
tr	5	Carlisle , Cumbria , UK : Friday 26th April 1974 Ten years earlier near the Scottish border , Barry Peters sat alone in his bedroom .
tr	5	Whist most in the group concentrated on their left hand fingering , Barry found he could look away from the guitar neck and listen to the ensemble .
tr	5	Bring me a song that says what you want to say and I don 't mind how rubbish it is or how rubbish you think it is .

tr	5	Flowering vines and corn plants brushed and scraped against the station wagon as Spyder drove hard towards a small farmhouse a few hundred feet ahead .

tr	5	At sixteen , Maggie finally had enough of the endless mowing , weeding , and pruning and asked her father to take her to the airfield .

tr	5	They discussed flying for a while , and she asked him what it would cost to go up in an airplane to see what it was like .
tr	5	That sounded like a lot of money to Maggie , so she shyly said that she would think about it , and would ask her father .

tr	5	The owner of the eyes squinted the left one as he framed the small waist in the air with his fingers , and thought , Perfect .
tr	5	He looked through the binoculars as the guns boomed repeatedly beside him and saw officers and NCO 's falling to the ground with horrific wounds .
tr	5	Big and ferocious creatures weren 't going to be the answer , history had shown that they instantly turned into crispy critters or starved to death .

tr	5	The monster 's jaws opened devouring the dog , sucking out all its goodness as well as its life-force before tossing its desiccated carcass away .
tr	5	It was hard to see straight as his tears froze onto his lashes and the snow pouring from the creature in all directions confused him .

tr	5	Taylor stepped out into the quiet darkness of the barnyard to find Lilly Ann sitting on a hay wagon contemplating the straw she was gnawing on .
